<p>Nothing is more useful to a youth than to be able to do a
little carpentering. To be handy with a chisel and saw, a
nail and a hammer, saves many a dollar in the course of the
year. If you call in a carpenter for a little work he is sure to
spin out a “regular job.” I remember once buying some oak
saplings, which cost me fifteen cents a stick; and wanting to
build a summer-house, I required eight of them to be sawn
through, so I applied to a carpenter, and the sticks were cut,
but, to my astonishment, four dollars was charged for
this little “job,” although the wood cost me only one dollar
and thirty cents. I found out afterwards that the proper
price for sawing would have amounted to about one dollar,
so that three dollars profit was clapped on for the benefit
of my experience. I just mention this to show my young
friends that if they wish to make summer-houses for their
gardens, cages for their birds, fowl-houses, rabbit-hutches, or
boxes for their books, they must learn to make them for
themselves. I shall therefore offer them a little advice upon
“carpentering.”</p>


<h3>THE SHOP AND BENCH.</h3>

<p>Endeavor to procure some small outhouse, in which you
may erect what is called a carpenter’s or joiner’s bench.
These may very often be bought second-hand, or if not, can
easily be procured at a reasonable rate. I am very particular
in recommending a bench, as without it you will find many
obstacles to your work. You must also provide yourself with
a set of tools,—gimlets, hammers, planes, saws, gouges, files,
nails, screws, and such articles of use.</p>

<p>The bench is composed of a platform or top, supported by
four stout legs; supplied with a bench hook; this ought to be
fitted in tight, so as to move up and down with a hammer
only. The use of it is to keep any wood steady you may have
to plane; the bench screw is used for keeping any wood firm
and steady you may have to saw, which is to be put in the
grip and screwed tight. Sometimes the edges of wood require
to be planed, and then the wood is put in the grip or cheeks
of the bench and held tight while you plane it. Make holes in
the side of the bench, for the insertion of a movable pin to<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
support the end of the board you have to plane or saw, which
is not in the screw. The height of your bench should be about
2 feet 8 inches. The common length is from 10 to 12 feet,
and the breadth about 3 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>The jack plane is the first to be used. It is about
17 inches in length, and is used to take the rough parts from
a piece of wood. It should be held steadily by fixing the right
hand at the handle, and the left over the top and side, and
pushed forward on the wood, when the knife will take off a
shaving which runs through the hole, and falls on the side.
In using the plane the endeavor should be to take off a clean
shaving, which is done by using the instrument uniformly and
steadily over every surface to be planed.</p>

<p>There is another kind of plane, called the trying plane, having
a double top or handle. It is used to regulate and smooth to a
higher degree, the surface of the wood that had previously
been smoothed from the rough by the jack plane. Its length is
about 22 inches, and it is broader than the jack plane. There
is another plane called the <em>long</em> plane, which is used for facing
a piece of stuff, which it does with the greatest exactness;
its length is about 2 feet 4 inches. There is also the joiner’s
plane, which is the longest of all the planes, being 30 inches
long. But the most handy of the planes to the boy carpenter
is the smoothing plane. It is the last plane used in joining,
and gives the utmost degree of smoothness to the surface of
a piece of finished work; it is about 7 inches in length, the
sides of the stock are curved, and resemble in figure a coffin;
it is used in a similar way to the other.</p>


<h3>SAWS.</h3>

<p>There are many kinds of saws, but the most useful one is
what is called the “hand saw.” It has a blade or plate about
28 inches long; the teeth of which are so formed as to allow
you to cut the wood crossways as well as lengthways. The
handle of the saw is made so as to allow a full yet free grasp
of the hand, either for a pull or a thrust.</p>

<p>The <em>panel saw</em>. This saw has a plate nearly of the same
size as a hand saw, and is used for cutting very thin boards,
which the rough teeth of the hand saw would not cut through
without breaking them.</p>

<p>The <em>tenon saw</em> is of a different shape to the others, and is
made to cut across the grain of the wood so as to leave the
ends nicely even, that it may fit to the piece it is joined to,
which is called a shoulder, being that part which comes in
contact with the fiber of the wood. To do this it requires
that the teeth should be much smaller, and they are<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
therefore placed so close as eight or ten to the inch, according
to the length of the blade.</p>

<p>The <em>dovetail saw</em>. There is another most useful saw it would
be of advantage for the young carpenter to have, namely, the
dovetail saw. It is about 9 inches long, and contains at least
fifteen teeth in the inch. It is used for cutting the dovetails
of boxes. Its plate is very thin, and it requires some care in
using. It has a back for the purpose of strength, formed of a
thin piece of brass or iron, let in so as to give the blade the
requisite firmness necessary in using it.</p>

<p>The <em>compass saw</em>. The plate of this kind of saw is very
narrow, and not more than one inch wide at the broadest
part, gradually diminishing to about a quarter of an inch at
the lower end. It is about 15 inches in length, and used for
cutting a piece of wood into a circular form, and the plate
being narrow allows it to follow the foot of the compass to a
very small diameter.</p>

<p>The <em>keyhole saw</em>. The keyhole saw is much smaller than
the above. It is used for cutting short curves, small holes,
&amp;c., such as a keyhole. The handle is the same form as that
of the chisel, a small slit being cut through from end to end.
It has a screw on one side, in order that the blade may be set
to any length, according to the circumference of the hole to
be cut.</p>


<h3>THE SPOKE SHAVE.</h3>

<p>This is a very useful tool. It is employed for smoothing the
edges of round pieces, or other ends requiring to be shaved
down. It is a narrow plane made of boxwood, and has generally
a steel blade let into it to cut; it is used by taking hold
of each end with a hand, and moving it to and fro over the
wood to be shaved down.</p>


<h3>STOCK AND BITS.</h3>

<p>There are about thirty-six bits to a set, all of different shapes
and sizes; but our young friends need not get quite so many;
if they provide themselves with a couple of a medium size,
this will be sufficient, such as the center bit and the auger bit.
The center bit will cut holes varying from a quarter of an inch
to three quarters of an inch in diameter, and is used by pressing
the knob end against the chest, and twirling the center
part round with the hand. It cuts a hole very clean, leaving
it quite smooth inside. The auger bit is for the same purpose,
and is used in the same manner. Another bit, called the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
taper shell bit, is used for making holes wider, and is a very
useful implement.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MAKE A WHEELBARROW.</h3>

<p>One of the handiest things in a garden is a wheelbarrow,
and one of the prettiest for the young carpenter to exercise
his ingenuity upon. To make one, take a wide plank or board
about an inch and a quarter thick. Proceed to your bench,
and having fitted it to its proper position, take your jack plane
and plane off the rough, next use your smoothing plane to
make it smooth. Then take your pencil and draw upon its
side the figure of a wheelbarrow. Then take your compass
saw and cut round the marks you have made: to do this you
will have to fix your board in the screw of your bench. When
this is done take your spoke shave, and shave the edges all
round till they are very smooth and even, and you have one
side of your barrow. Lay this on another piece of board, and
mark the shape of it with your pencil; cut and shave it exactly
as you did the first side, so that when finished the
two will exactly correspond; then cut a piece off another
board for the back and front of the barrow,
by the same method you cut the sides, and plane and finish
them up in a similar way. Cut some tenons at the end of each
exactly to correspond with the mortices on the sides, let them
be a trifle larger than the mortices, so that they will drive in
tight. Then cut the bottom out neatly, and nail it to the
sides. Having proceeded thus far, cut out the legs of your
barrow, and nail one on each side. Give each leg a shoulder
for the sides to rest upon.</p>

<p><em>To make the wheel.</em> Take a piece of board, and strike a
circle upon it the size you wish your wheel to be of, and with
the compass saw cut close round to the stroke; cut out a
square hole in the center for the nave to join. Then get the
blacksmith to put an iron rim round the wheel to keep it from
splitting, and a round pin in each side of the nave, and put a
staple in each side of the barrow to keep the wheel in its
place. Paint the whole of any color you choose, and you will
have a wheelbarrow.</p>


<h3>THE WAY TO MAKE A BOX.</h3>

<p>First ascertain the size you wish your box to be of. Then
cut off your stuff, but take care to cut it a quarter of an inch
longer than the size of your box from outside to outside.
Should you want it deeper or broader than the length of a
deal, the widest of which is generally only eleven inches; suppose,
for instance, you wish your box to be 18 inches deep,
and you have only 9-inch deal to make it with, you will of<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
course have to join two together, or make what is called in
carpentering a <em>gluejoint</em>. First, then, after you have cut off
your stuff, take your jack plane and “scuffle the rough off,”
then put your board edgeways into the bench-screw, and take
your trying plane or long plane to get the edge of the deals
that are to be glued together perfectly straight and even;
and lastly use the joiner plane, which will take off a nice uniform
shaving of the whole length of the board. Proceed
exactly in the same manner with the other board to be joined
to the first. Then, after having made each thoroughly
smooth, clap the two together and see if they will lie close in
every part; if not you must plane them till they do, taking
care to plane the edges perfectly square, or at right angles
to the surface of the board, for if you are not careful in this
particular, when your boards are glued together they will be
of this form. When you have joined them properly for glueing,
let your glue be nicely hot and not too thick, and hold
both edges of the boards together so that you can with a
brush put the glue on both at one time, put the two together
very quickly, let one of them be in the bench-screw, and
while there rub the other backwards and forwards until the
glue sets, which it will soon do if well joined. Let the whole
dry, and then the glued part will be as strong as any other
part of the board.</p>

<p>After your sides, ends, bottom, and top are thus prepared,
you must then plane them up nicely, so that they are perfectly
smooth and straight. Use first the jack plane, then the
trying plane. When this is done you have to proceed to a
nice little job, namely, to dovetail the corners together so as
to form your box. In this process much depends upon the
planing and squaring of the stuff, for if you have not done
this nicely the dovetailing will be very imperfectly performed.
Assuming that everything has been well done, then take the
two ends of the box, and see that each is perfectly square and
true to the other. Then allow one-eighth of an inch more
than the thickness of your sides, and set out the ends, squaring
it over on both sides, which when the dovetails are cut
out will form the inside of the box.</p>


<h3>TO CUT THE DOVETAILS.</h3>

<p>Take one “end-piece” of the box, and place it endways
into the bench-screw, and mark out the dovetails on the edge
of the board inside, then with your dovetail saw cut in into
the marks down to the lines squared over on the flat side. Then
with a chisel cut out that part of the wood that is crossed,
and leave the other part, this being the part which will form
the pins or tails. Then take one side of your box and lay it<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
flat on the bench, the inside uppermost; then place the end
you have cut on it, keeping the edges flush, and mark round
the shape of the pins, which will leave their form on the side
piece, the black places being the mortices which are to be cut
out. In cutting out these you must be careful to cut within
side of the stroke, so that the mortices will be a little smaller
than the pins, which will admit of their being driven in quite
tight, and will allow the glue to adhere to them (for you have
to glue these when you fix them). When you have thus put
the ends and sides together let them stand till the glue gets
dry, then take your planes and plane the quarter of an inch
off the pins which you allowed to be a little longer than the
length of the box, and you have then made the body of your
box.</p>


<h3>THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX.</h3>

<p>Cut your bottom the exact size of the box, nail the bottom
on, and “get out” a piece of wood (by cutting and planing
in the usual manner) to nail round so as to form a skirting to
it, and at the same time hide the joints of the bottom; “get
out” a similar piece of wood to nail round the top which will
form the lid. Then get a pair of box joints and a lock, and
having put them on by a stroke of your own ingenuity, you
will have a “box.”</p>

<p>Galvanism, or electricity of quantity, in contradistinction
to frictional electricity, called electricity of intensity, owes its
name to the experiments on animal irritability made in 1790
by M. Galvani, a professor of anatomy at Bologna. These
experiments were suggested by the following circumstances.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN OF GALVANISM.</h3>

<p>It happened that the wife of Galvani, who was consumptive,
was advised to take as an article of food some soup made
of the flesh of frogs. Several of these creatures were killed
and skinned, and were lying on the table in the laboratory
close to an electrical machine, with which a pupil of the professor<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
was making experiments. While the machine was in
action, he chanced to touch the bare nerve of the leg of one of
the frogs with the blade of the knife that he had in his hand,
when suddenly the whole limb was thrown into violent convulsions.
Galvani was not present when this occurred; but being
informed of it, he immediately set himself to investigate the
cause. He found that it was only when a spark was drawn
from the prime conductor, and when the knife or any other
good conductor was in contact with the nerve, that the contracting
took place; and after a time he discovered that the
effect was independent of the electrical machine, and might
be equally well produced by making a metallic communication
between the outside muscle and the crural nerve.</p>


<h3>SIMPLE EXPERIMENT TO EXCITE GALVANIC ACTION.</h3>

<p>If the young experimenter will obtain a piece of zinc of the
size of half a dollar and place it on the top of his tongue, and
place a half-dollar beneath it, and bring the edges of the half-dollar
and zinc in contact in front of his tongue, he will notice
a peculiar sensation in the nerves of this organ, and some
taste will be imparted to his mouth at the moment of contact.</p>


<h3>WITH METAL PLATES IN WATER.</h3>

<p>If we take two plates of different kinds of metal, platinum
(or copper) and zinc for example, and immerse them in pure
water, having wires attached to them above, then if the wire of
each is brought into contact in another vessel of water, a galvanic
circle will be formed, the water will be slowly decomposed,
its oxygen will be fixed on the zinc wire, and at the same
time a current of electricity will be transmitted through the
liquid to the platina or copper wire, on the end of which the
other element of water, namely, the hydrogen, will make its
appearance in the form of minute gas bubbles. The electrical
current passes back again into the zinc at the points of its contact
with the platina, and thus a continued current is kept
up, and hence it is called a galvanic circle. The moment the
circuit is broken by separating the wires the current ceases,
but is again renewed by making them touch either in or out
of the water. If a small quantity of sulphuric acid be added
to the water, the phenomenon will be more apparent. The
end of the wire attached to the piece of platinum or copper is
called the positive pole of the battery, and that of the wire
attached to the zinc the negative pole.</p>

<p>The current of electricity here generated will be extremely
feeble; but this can be easily increased by multiplying the
glasses and the number of the pieces of metal. If we take
six such glasses instead of one, partially fill them with dilute<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
sulphuric acid, and put a piece of zinc and copper into each,
connecting them by means of copper wire from glass to glass
through the whole series, a stronger current of electricity will
be the result. The experimenter must be careful not to let
the wire and zinc touch each other at the bottom of the tumblers,
and must also remember that the copper of glass 1 is
connected with the zinc of glass 2, and so on.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A MAGNET BY THE VOLTAIC CURRENT.</h3>

<p>To effect this, make a connection between the poles of the
above or any excited battery with the two ends of a wire
formed into a spiral coil, by bending common bonnet-wire
closely round a cylinder, or tube, of about an inch in diameter;
into this coil introduce a needle or piece of steel wire, laying
it lengthways down the circles of the coil. In a few minutes
after the electric fluid has passed through the spiral wire, and
consequently round the needle or wire, the latter will be
found to be strongly magnetized, and to possess all the properties
of a magnet.</p>


<h3>EFFECTS OF GALVANISM ON A MAGNET.</h3>

<p>If a galvanic current, or any electric current, be made to
pass along a wire under which, and in a line with it, a compass
is placed, it will be found that the needle will no longer
point north and south, but will take a direction nearly across
the current, and point almost east and west.</p>


<h3>CHANGE OF COLOR BY GALVANISM.</h3>

<p>Put a teaspoonful of sulphate of soda into a cup, and dissolve
it in hot water; pour a little cabbage blue into the
solution, and put a portion into two glasses, connecting them
by a piece of linen or cotton cloth previously moistened in
the same solution. On putting one of the wires of the galvanic
pole into each glass, the acid accumulates in the one,
turning the blue to a red, and the alkali in the other, rendering
it green. If the wires be now reversed, the acid accumulates
eventually in the glass where the alkali appeared, while
the alkali passes to the glass where the acid was.</p>


<h3>THE GALVANIC SHOCK.</h3>

<p>If the ends of the wires of a small galvanic battery are
connected with a proper electro-magnetic coil, which may
now be purchased at a very cheap rate, and the wires from the
coil be placed in separate basins of water, then, on dipping<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
the fingers of each hand in the basin, a smart shock will be
felt, with a particular aching accompanied with trembling.
With a strong battery and larger coil this effect is felt as high
as the shoulders. The shock will also be felt by simply holding
the wires of a powerful galvanic battery, one in each hand,
provided the hands be moistened with salt and water. Several
persons may receive the shock from the battery and coil together
by joining hands.</p>


<h3>THE ELECTROTYPE.</h3>

<p>The electro-galvanic current has in no case been more interestingly
employed than in the process of electrotyping. It
consists of a mode of obtaining the copy of coins, medals,
engraved plates, and other objects, which may be easily
illustrated.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTROTYPE APPARATUS.</h3>

<p>Take an earthen jar and a porous tube; fill the tube with ten
parts of water and one of sulphuric acid; put it into the jar,
into which pour as much of a solution of sulphate of copper
(blue vitriol) as will fill three parts of it; place in the tube a
piece of zinc, to which a copper wire is soldered and bent
round, so that one end be immersed in the sulphate of copper;
and a deposit of the copper will be immediately formed upon
the wire. If there be plenty of acid and water, so as to allow
of the action enduring for a long time, this process will go on
till it has deposited all the copper. This is the principle upon
which electrotyping proceeds—a principle referable to electro-chemical
decomposition.</p>


<h3>TO OBTAIN THE COPY OF A COIN OR MEDAL.</h3>

<p>Never place the original medal in the apparatus, or the deposited
copper may adhere so tightly to it that the removal
destroys the beauty of the medal. Having taken an impression
in sealing-wax, cover the latter with black-lead, and attach
a wire so that it is in contact with the black-lead. To
the wire and cast thus arranged a piece of sheet or cast zinc,
amalgamated with mercury, must be attached, and we are at
once furnished with the materials for the battery, as the object
to be copied supplies the place of the copper. The medal
must always be placed horizontally. Now let the apparatus
be charged with the solution, by pouring into the outer vessel
a portion of the coppery solution, so that it will stand about
an inch above the medal; then pour in the glass the dilute
acid to the same height as the former; now introduce the zinc<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
into the acid, and the object to be copied into the solution of
copper, which will immediately be deposited on the medal, and
when of a sufficient thickness may be taken off.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HEAT">HEAT.</h2>
</div>


<h3>HEAT, OR CALORIC.</h3>

<p>The chief agent in causing the repulsion or separation of
the particles of bodies from each other is heat, or more correctly
<em>caloric</em>, by which is understood the unknown <em>cause</em> of
the effect called heat. Philosophers are not agreed upon the
nature of this wonderful agent. It pervades all nature, is the
cause of nearly all the changes that take place both in organic
and inorganic matter, and has great influence in the meteorological
phenomena which we observe in the atmosphere that
surrounds our planet. It appears to be intimately connected
with light, electricity, and magnetism—subjects which the
genius of Faraday and others have investigated, and by their
discoveries brought us nearer to the knowledge of the real nature
of these most wonderful forces.</p>

<p>Caloric, then, exists in all bodies, and has a constant tendency
to equalize itself, as far at least as its outward manifestation,
called temperature, is concerned; for if a <em>hot</em> body
be brought near colder ones, it will give up heat to them, until
by its loss and their gain they all become of the same temperature;
and this proceeds more or less rapidly, according
as the original difference of temperature was greater or less.
Some other circumstances also influence this equalization.
The converse will take place on introducing a cold body among
warmer ones, when heat will be abstracted from all the bodies
within reach of its influence, until it has absorbed sufficient
caloric to bring its own temperature to an equality with theirs.
This is the true explanation of the apparent production of
<em>cold</em>. When, for instance, an iceberg comes across a ship’s
course, it appears to <em>give out</em> cold, whereas it has abstracted
the heat from the air and sea in its neighborhood, and they in
turn act upon the ship and everything in it, until one common
temperature is produced in all the neighboring bodies.</p>

<p>It does not follow that the bodies thus equalized in temperature
contain equal quantities of caloric; far from it. Each
body requires a particular quantity of caloric to raise its temperature
through a certain number of degrees; and such
quantity is called its <em>specific</em> caloric. A pound of water, for
instance, will take just twice as much caloric as a pound of<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
olive oil, to raise its temperature through the same number
of degrees; the <em>specific</em> caloric of water is therefore double
that of oil. Mix any quantity of oil at 60 deg. of temperature
with an equal weight of water at 90 deg., and you will find the
temperature of the mixture to be nearly 80 deg., instead of only
74 deg. or 75 deg., showing that while the water has lost only 10
deg. of caloric, the mixture has risen 20 deg. If the oil be at 90
deg., and the water at 60 deg., the resulting temperature will
be only 70 deg., or thereabouts, instead of 75 deg., the mean;
thus, here the hot oil has lost 20 deg., while the mixture has
risen only 10 deg.; the water, then, contains at the same temperature
<em>twice</em> as much caloric as the oil; its specific caloric
is <em>double</em> that of the oil. This mean temperature does result
when equal weights of the same body at different temperatures
are mixed together.</p>

<p>The sensations called heat and cold are by no means accurate
measures of the real temperature of any substances, for
many causes influence these sensations, some belonging to
the substances themselves, others to the state of our organs
at the time. Every one has remarked that metals in a warm
room feel warmer, and in a cold room colder than wooden articles,
and these again than woolen or cotton articles of dress
or furniture; this arises from metals being what is termed better
<em>conductors</em> of heat than wood, and this better than wool,
&amp;c., that is, they give out or absorb caloric more rapidly than
these last. Some philosophers, wishing to ascertain how much
heat the human body could endure, had a room heated with
stoves, every crevice being carefully stopped, until the temperature
rose so high that a beefsteak placed on the table was
sufficiently cooked to be eaten. They were dressed in flannel,
and could with impunity touch the carpets, curtains, &amp;c., in
the room; but the iron handles, fire-irons, and all metallic
substances, burnt their fingers; and one who wore silver spectacles
was obliged to remove them to save his nose. The fallacy
of our sensations may be easily shown by taking two
basins, placing in one some water at 100 deg., in another
some water at as low a temperature as can easily be procured—hold
the right hand in one, the left in the other, for a few
minutes, and then mix them, and place both hands in the
mixture; it will feel quite <em>cold</em> to the hand that had been in
the hotter water, and <em>hot</em> to the other.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a correct estimate of the temperature
of bodies, instruments are made use of called thermometers,
or measurers of heat, which show increase or diminution of
temperature by the rising or falling of a column of some fluid
in a tube of glass, one end of which is expanded into a bulb,
and the other hermetically sealed. This effect is produced by<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
the expansion or swelling of the fluid as caloric is added to,
and its contraction when caloric is abstracted from it. Colored
spirits of wine, or quicksilver, are the most usual thermometric
fluids, and the tube containing them is fixed to a
wooden or metallic frame, on which certain divisions are
marked, called degrees.</p>

<p>That in general use in America is called Fahrenheit’s from
the name of the person who first introduced that particular
scale. In this thermometer, the point at which the mercury
in the tube stands when plunged into melting ice, is marked
32 degrees, and the distance between that point and the point
to which the mercury rises in boiling water is divided into 180
equal parts, called degrees; so that water is said to boil at
212 degrees = 180 degrees + 32 degrees. There are two
other scales of temperature used in different parts of the
world, but it is not worth while to notice them here.</p>

<p>Not only do different bodies at the same degree of temperature
contain very different quantities of caloric, but this also
is the case with the same body in different forms. Ice, water,
and steam are three forms of the same body, but ice at 32
degrees contains much less caloric than water at the same
temperature, and water at 212 degrees contains much less
caloric than steam (or water in a state of vapor) at that temperature.</p>

<p>Place in a jar any given quantity of snow, or small pieces
of ice, at 32 degrees, and in another the same weight of water
at 32 degrees, pour on each an equal weight of water at 172
degrees, and you will find that in the first case the ice will be
melted, but the temperature will remain at 32 degrees, or
thereabouts, while the temperature of the water in the other
vessel will have risen to 100 degrees or thereabouts, being as
near as possible the half of the excess of the temperature of
the hot water, 140 degrees over that of the cold, namely 70
degrees added to 32 degrees, the original temperature. Now,
what has become of the heat which was added to the ice, and
is apparently lost?—it is <em>absorbed</em> by the ice in its passage
to the fluid state; so that water may be said to be a compound
of ice and caloric.</p>

<p>Again, take 10 ounces of water at about 50 degrees, and
add 1 oz. of water at 212 degrees, and the temperature of the
mixture will be about 66 degrees; then condense some steam
at 212 degrees into another 10 oz. of water until it has become
11 oz., and you will find the temperature will be nearly
212 degrees. Why does the ounce of steam at 212 degrees
raise the temperature of the water so much higher than the
ounce of water at the same temperature? Obviously because
it contains hidden in its substance a vast quantity of caloric,<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
not to be detected by the thermometer; in fact, that steam is
a compound of <em>water</em> and caloric, as water is a compound of
<em>ice</em> and caloric; and this caloric which exists, more or less, in
all bodies without producing any obvious effect, is called
<em>latent</em> caloric, from the Latin verb <i lang="la">lateo</i>, to lie hid. The
quantity of caloric thus absorbed, as it were, by various bodies,
differs for each body, and for the same body in different
forms, as mentioned above.</p>


<h3>EXPANSION.</h3>

<p>As a general rule, all bodies, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous,
are expanded by caloric. This may be shown by experiments
in each form of matter.</p>

<p>Have a small iron rod made, which when cold just passes
through a hole in a plate of metal; heat it, and it will no
longer pass; after a time the rod will return to its former
temperature, and then will go through the hole as before.
The rod increases in length as well as width; if you have a
gauge divided into <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">100</span> of an inch, and place the rod in it
when cold, noting its position, on heating it will extend to a
greater length in the gauge, returning to its former place
when cool.</p>

<p>The effect of caloric in causing fluids to expand is actually
employed as a measure of quantity in the thermometer, the
rise of the fluid in the tube when heated depending on the
increased bulk of the fluid occasioned by the addition of
caloric. The same fact is to be noticed every day when the
cook fills the kettle, and places it on the fire. As the water
becomes warmer it expands, that is, takes up more room
than it did before, and the water escapes by slow degrees, increasing
as the heat increases, up to the point of boiling,
when a sudden commotion takes place from the condensation
of a portion of the water into steam.</p>

<p>But it is in the form of vapor or gas (which, by the bye, is
not the same thing), that the expansive force of caloric is
most obvious. The gigantic powers of the steam-engine depend
entirely on the tendency of vapor to expand on the addition
of caloric; and this force of expansion appears to have no
limit; boilers made of iron plates an inch or even more in
thickness, and the buildings or ships containing them, having
been torn to pieces and scattered in all directions by the expansive
power of steam. Take a bladder and fill it about
half-full of air, and tie the neck securely; upon holding it to
the fire it will swell out and become quite tense from the
expansion of the contained air.</p>

<p>The principal source of caloric is the sun, whose beams,
diffused through all nature by the refractive property of the<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
atmosphere, are the source of vitality both to vegetables and
animals, and when concentrated by a large convex lens, produce
the most intense heat, sufficient to light a piece of diamond,
and melt platinum. Caloric is also produced or evolved
by combustion, by friction, percussion, chemical combination,
electricity, and galvanism.</p>

<p>The evolution of heat by friction may be witnessed daily in
a thousand instances. Lucifer matches are lighted by rubbing
the highly inflammable substances with which they are tipped
against a piece of sand-paper. Nearly all savage people
procure fire by rubbing a piece of hard wood violently against
a softer piece. The axle-trees of steam-engines, and even of
carriages, have been known to be so heated by friction as to
endanger burning the carriage; and it is very usual to be
obliged to pour a quantity of cold water on the iron axle of the
carriages of an express train after an hour of constant and
rapid work. If you merely rub the blade of a knife rapidly on
a piece of wood it will become hot enough to burn your hand.</p>

<p>Percussion is merely a more energetic kind of friction, and
is often resorted to by the blacksmith to light his furnace.
He places a nail or other piece of soft iron on his anvil, and
beats it rapidly with the hammer, when it becomes actually
red hot. The production of sparks by striking flint against
steel, or two pieces of flint one against the other, are familiar
instances of heat produced by percussion.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful means of producing heat is the
process of combustion.</p>

<p>Combustion, as the word imports, is the <em>burning together</em>
of two or more substances, a chemical union of oxygen generally
with carbon and hydrogen in some shape or other. In
our ordinary fires we burn coal, a hydro-carbon as it is called;
and the gas which is now so universally used for the purpose
of illumination, is a compound of the same bodies—so wax,
tallow, oil of various kinds, both of animal and vegetable
origin, are all hydro-carbons.</p>

<p>On the application of a sufficient heat, and a free access of
atmospheric air, or of some other gas containing oxygen in a
certain state of combination, these bodies take fire, and continue
to burn either with flame, or a red or even white heat
without flame, until they are consumed; that is, until they
have entered into new combinations with the oxygen, and are
converted into carbonic acid and water, the carbon forming
the first product, the hydrogen the other.</p>

<p>The following experiment shows the productions of heat by
chemical action alone. Bruise some fresh prepared crystals
of nitrate of copper, spread them over a piece of tin foil,
sprinkle them with a little water; then fold up the foil tightly as<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
rapidly as possible, and in a minute or two it will become red-hot,
the tin apparently burning away. The heat is produced
by the energetic action of the tin on the nitrate of copper,
taking away its oxygen in order to unite with the nitrate acid,
for which, as well as for the oxygen, the tin has a much
greater affinity than the copper has.</p>

<p>Combustion without flame may be shown in a very elegant
and agreeable manner, by making a coil of platinum wire by
twisting it round the stem of a tobacco-pipe, or any cylindrical
body, for a dozen times or so, leaving about an inch
straight, which should be inserted into the wick of a spirit-lamp;
light the lamp, and after it has burnt for a minute or
two extinguish the flame quickly; the wire will soon become
red-hot, and, if kept from draughts of air, will continue to
burn until all the spirit is consumed. Spongy platinum, as it
is called, answers rather better than wire, and has been employed
in the formation of fumigators for the drawing-room,
in which, instead of pure spirits, some perfume, such as
lavender water, is used; by its combustion an agreeable
odor is diffused through the apartment. These little lamps
were much in vogue a few years ago, but are now nearly out
of fashion.</p>

<p>Experiments on combustion might be multiplied almost to
any amount, but the above will be sufficient for the present.
When we come to treat of the properties of the gases and
some other substances, we shall have occasion to recur to
this subject.</p>

<p>The production of caloric by chemical combination may be
exhibited by mixing carefully one part of oil of vitriol with
two of water, when sufficient heat will be produced to boil
some water in a thin and narrow tube, which may be used as
a rod to stir the mixture.</p>

<p>The production of heat by electric and galvanic agency belongs
to another subject.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HYDRAULICS">HYDRAULICS.</h2>
</div>


<p>The science of Hydraulics comprehends the laws which regulate
non-elastic fluids in motion, and especially water, etc.</p>

<p>Water can only be set in motion by two causes—the pressure
of the atmosphere, or its own gravity. The principal law
concerning fluids is, that they always preserve their own
level. Hence water can be distributed over a town from any<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
reservoir that is higher than the houses to be supplied; and
the same principle will enable us to form fountains in a garden,
or other place. Should any of our young readers wish to form
a fountain, they may, by bringing a pipe from a water-tank,
which should be at the upper part of the house, convey the
water down to the garden. Then, by leading it through the
earth, underneath the path or grass-plot, and turning it to a
perpendicular position, the water will spring out, and rise
nearly as high as the level of that in the tank. The pipe
should have a faucet, so that the water may be let on or shut
off at pleasure.</p>


<h3>THE SYPHON.</h3>

<p>The syphon is a bent tube, having one leg shorter than the
other. It acts by the pressure of the atmosphere. In order
to make a syphon act, it is necessary first to fill both legs
quite full of the fluid, and then the shorter leg must be placed
in the vessel to be emptied. Immediately upon withdrawing
the finger from the longer leg, the liquor will flow.</p>


<h3>THE PUMP.</h3>

<p>The action of the common pump is as follows: When the
handle is raised, the piston-rod descends, and brings the piston-valve—called
the sucker, or bucket—to another valve,
which is fixed, and opens inward towards the piston. When
the handle is drawn down, the piston is raised, and, as it is
air-tight, a vacuum is produced between the two valves; the
air in the barrel of the pump, betwixt the lower valve and the
water, then forces open the lower valve, and rushes through
to fill up this vacuum; and the air in the pump being less
dense than the external atmosphere, the water is forced a
short way up the barrel. When the piston again descends to
the lower valve, the air between them is again forced out by
forcing open the upper valve; and when the piston is raised, a
vacuum is again produced, and the air below the lower valve
rushes up, and the water in consequence is again raised a little
further. This operation continues until the water rises above
the lower valve; at every stroke afterwards, the water passes
through the valve of the descending piston, and is raised by
it, on its ascent, until it issues out of the spout.</p>


<h3>THE HYDRAULIC DANCER.</h3>

<p>Make a little figure of cork, in the shape of a dancing
mountebank, sailor, etc. In this figure place a small hollow
cone, made of thin leaf brass. When this figure is placed
upon any jet, such as that of the fountain recommended to be
constructed, it will be suspended on the top of the water, and<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
perform a great variety of amusing motions. If a hollow ball
of very thin copper, of an inch in diameter, be placed on a
similar jet, it will remain suspended, turning round and
spreading the water all about it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="MAGNETISM">MAGNETISM.</h2>
</div>


<p>The attractive power of the loadstone has been known
from a very remote period. The natural magnet appears
native in a gray iron ore in octahedral crystals, composed of
168 parts of iron, and 64 parts of oxygen. Its properties
seem to have been studied in Europe during the dark ages
and a directive power is alluded to by Cardinal James de
Vitri, who flourished about the year 1200, who observed that
it was indispensable to those who travel much by sea.</p>

<p>In modern times, the history as well as the nature of the
magnet has engaged remarkable attention; and it has been
determined beyond all dispute that the magnet was used by
the Chinese under the name of the <em>tche-chy</em> (directing stone)
about 2604 years before Christ. It passed from them to the
Arabs, and was first used in Europe after the crusades; and
Ludi Vestomanus asserts that about the year 1500 he saw
a pilot in the East Indies direct his course by a magnetic
needle like those now in use.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS.</h3>

<p>This may be done by stroking a piece of hard steel with a
natural or artificial magnet. Take a common sewing needle
and pass the north pole of a magnet from the eye to the point,
pressing it gently in so doing. After reaching the end of the
needle the magnet must not be passed back again towards
the eye, but must be lifted up and applied again to that end,
the friction being always in the same direction. After repeating
this for a few times the needle will become magnetized,
and attract iron filings, etc.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MAGNETIZE A POKER.</h3>

<p>Hold it in the left hand in a position slightly inclined from
the perpendicular, the lower end pointing to the north, and
then strike it smartly several times with a large iron hammer,<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
and it will be found to possess the powers of a magnet,
although but slightly.</p>


<h3>TO SHOW MAGNETIC REPULSION AND ATTRACTION.</h3>

<p>Suspend two short pieces of iron wire, so that they will
hang in contact in a vertical position. If the north pole of a
magnet be now brought to a moderate distance between the
wires, they will recede from each other.</p>

<p>The ends being made south poles by induction from the
north pole, will repel each other, and so will the north poles.
This separation of the wires will increase as the magnet approaches
them, but there will be a particular distance at
which the attractive force overcomes the repulsive force of
the poles, and causes the wires to converge.</p>


<h3>NORTH AND SOUTH POLES OF THE MAGNET.</h3>

<p>Each magnet has its poles, north and south—the north or
south poles of one magnet repel the north and south pole of
another. If a magnet be dipped in some iron filings, they will
be immediately attracted to one end. Supposing this to be
the north pole, each of the ends of the filings, not in contact
with the magnet, will become north poles, while the ends
in contact will by induction become south poles. Both will
have a tendency to repel each other, and the filings will stand
on the magnet.</p>


<h3>POLARITY OF THE MAGNET.</h3>

<p>The best method of proving this is to take a magnet or a
piece of steel rendered magnetic, and to place it on a piece of
cork by laying it in a groove cut to receive it. If the cork
be placed in the center of a basin of water, and allowed to
swim freely on its surface, so that it is not attracted by the
sides of the basin, it will be found to turn its north pole to
the north, and its south pole to the south, the same as the
mariner’s compass. If you fix two magnets in two pieces of
cork, and place them also in a basin of water, and they are
in a parallel position with the same poles together, that is,
north to north, and south to south, they will mutually repel
each other; but if the contrary poles point to one another, as
north to south, they will be attracted.</p>


<h3>THE MAGNETIC FISH.</h3>

<p>Fish are to be purchased at the toy-stores, by which the
young “magnétique” may perform this experiment; they
are made hollow, and will float on the water. In the mouth
of each should be inserted a piece of magnetic wire. The
angling rod is like any other rod, and has a silken thread for<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
a line, and an iron hook also strongly magnetized. To catch
the fish it is only necessary to put the hook in contact with
the noses of the fish, and they will be taken without any bait.</p>


<h3>THE MAGNETIC SWAN.</h3>

<p>The figure of a swan should be cut in cork, and within its
beak a small strongly magnetized piece of steel should be
placed. The swan should then be covered with a coating of
white wax, and fashioned further into the shape of a swan,
and glass beads may be placed in its head for eyes. This
should be placed in a small tub or large basin of water, and to
make it swim about, you should place in a white stick about
nine inches long a magnetic bar, on which the north and south
poles are marked. If you wish to bring the swan towards
you, present to him the north pole of the wand, if you wish it
to retire, present the south pole, and thus you may direct the
swan to any part you desire.</p>


<h3>TO SUSPEND A NEEDLE IN THE AIR BY MAGNETISM.</h3>

<p>Place a magnet on a stand to raise it a little above the table;
then bring a small sewing needle containing a thread,
within a little of the magnet, keeping hold of the thread to
prevent the needle from attaching itself to the magnet. The
needle in endeavoring to fly to the magnet, and being prevented
by the thread, will remain curiously suspended in the
air, reminding us of the fable of Mahomed’s coffin.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS WITHOUT THE AID EITHER OF
NATURAL LOADSTONES OR ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS.</h3>

<p>Take an iron poker and tongs, or two bars of iron, the larger
and the older the better, and fixing the poker upright, hold to
it with the left hand near the top by a silk thread, a bar of soft
steel about three inches long, one-fourth of an inch broad and
one-twentieth thick; mark one end, and let this end be downwards.
Then grasping the tongs with the right hand a little
below the middle, and keeping them nearly in a vertical line,
let the bar be rubbed with the lower end of the tongs, from the
marked end of the bar to its upper end about ten times of each
side of it. By this means the bar will receive as much magnetism
as will enable it to lift a small key at the marked end;
and this end of the bar being suspended by its middle, or
made to rest on a joint, will turn to the north, and is called its
north pole, the unmarked end being the south pole. This is
the method recommended by Mr. Caxton, in his process,
which he regarded superior to those in former use, and of<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
which a more detailed account will be found in his interesting
volume.</p>


<h3>HORSE-SHOE MAGNETS.</h3>

<p>The form of a horse-shoe is generally given to magnetized
bars, when both poles are wanted to act together, which frequently
happens in various experiments, such as for lifting
weights by the force of magnetic attraction, and for magnetizing
steel bars by the process of double touch, for which they
are exceedingly convenient. The following is the method of
making a powerful magnetic battery of the horse-shoe form.
Twelve bars or plates of steel are to be taken, and having been
previously bent to the required form, that is, the horse-shoe
shape, they are then bound together by means of rivets at
their ends; before being finally fastened they are each separately
magnetized and afterwards finally united.</p>

<p>Horse-shoe magnets should have a short bar of soft iron
adapted to connect the two poles, and should never be laid
by without such a piece of iron adhering to them. Bar magnets
should be kept in pairs with their poles turned in contrary
directions, and they should be kept from rust. Both
kinds of magnets have their power not only preserved but increased,
by keeping them surrounded with a mass of dry filings
of soft iron, each particle of which will re-act by its induced
magnetism upon the point of the magnet to which it
adheres, and maintain in that point its primitive magnetic
state.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENT TO SHOW THAT SOFT IRON POSSESSES MAGNETIC
PROPERTIES WHILE IT REMAINS IN THE
VICINITY OF A MAGNET.</h3>

<p>Let a magnet and a key be held horizontally near one of its
poles, or near its lower edge. Then if another piece of iron,
such as a small nail, be applied to the other end of the key,
the nail will hang from the key, and will continue to do so
while the magnet is slowly withdrawn; but when it has been
removed beyond a certain distance, the nail will drop from
the key, because the magnetism induced in the key becomes
at that distance too weak to support the weight of the nail.
That this is the real cause of its falling off may be proved by
taking a still lighter fragment of iron, such as a piece of very
slender wire, and applying it to the key. The magnetism of
the key will still be sufficiently strong to support the wire,
though it cannot the nail, and it will continue to support it
even when the magnet is yet further removed; at length, however,
it drops off.</p>


<h3>ELECTRO-MAGNETISM.</h3>

<p>The identity of magnetism with electricity alluded to in a
former paragraph, has led to the formation of a new science<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
under the above name, and to some of the interesting experiments
connected with it, we shall briefly allude for the amusement
of the young reader.</p>


<h3>POWER OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNET.</h3>

<p>The same influence which affects the magnetic needle
already described, will also communicate magnetism to
soft iron. If a bar of that metal bent, be surrounded
with a common bonnet wire, or a copper wire prevented
from touching the iron by a winding of cotton or
thread, and then if a current of voltaic electricity be sent
through the wire, the bar becomes a powerful magnet, and will
continue so as long as the connection with the battery is preserved.
On breaking the contact, the magnetism disappears.
This experiment may be easily made by the young reader
with a horse-shoe magnet, surrounded by several coils of wire.</p>


<h3>THE MARINER’S COMPASS AND EXPERIMENTS WITH A POCKET
COMPASS.</h3>

<p>The mariner’s compass is an artificial magnet fitted in a
proper box, and consists of three parts—the box, the card or
fly, and the needle. The box is suspended in a square wooden
case, by means of two concentric brass circles called gimbals,
so fixed by brazen axes to the two boxes, that the inner
one, or compass-box, retains a horizontal position in all
motions of the ship. The card is a circular piece of paper
which is fastened upon the needle, and moves with it. The
outer edge of the card is divided into thirty-two points, called
points of the compass. The needle is a slender bar of hardened
steel, having a hollow agate cup in the center, which
moves upon the point of a pivot made of brass.</p>


<h3>VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE.</h3>

<p>The magnetic needle does not point exactly north and
south, but the north pole of the needle takes a direction to
the west of the true north. It is constantly changing, and
varies at different parts of the earth, and at different times of
the day.</p>


<h3>DIP OF THE NEEDLE.</h3>

<p>Another remarkable and evident manifestation of the influence
of the magnetism of the earth upon the needle is the inclination
or dip of the latter which is a deviation from its horizontal
place in a downward direction in northern regions of
its north, and in southern regions of its south pole. In balancing
the needle on the card, on account of this dipping, a
small weight or movable piece of brass is placed on one end<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
of the needle, by the shifting of which either nearer to or further
from the center, the needle will always be balanced.</p>


<h3>USEFUL AMUSEMENT WITH THE POCKET COMPASS.</h3>

<p>Pocket compasses are to be bought for from 50 cents to
$1, and may be used in many ways. In traveling over
mountains or a wide extended plain, they are indispensably
necessary, and no one should go on a tour without such a
companion; it will be a very useful and amusing exercise for any
young person to take the bearings of his own or some particular
locality, and make out what may be called a bearing card.
This he may easily do in the following manner: Supposing
he wishes, for instance, to take the bearings of his own house,
he has nothing to do but set his pocket compass upon a map
of the district,—a county map will do very well, unless his
house stands on the verge of a county, then two county maps
will be necessary. He must make the north of the map
exactly coincide with the north, as indicated by his compass,
and having fixed his map in this situation, he should take a
ruler and piece of paper, and dot down the exact bearings of
each important town, or place, or village, around him. Let
him suppose himself, for instance, in the town of Albany,
N. Y., and laying down his map as indicated by the compass,
north to north and south to south, he will find the following
places due north, Balston Spa; Hudson, south; Schoharie,
west. The other points of the compass may be filled up in
the same manner. Should, therefore, our young friend be
upon any other elevated situation near his own dwelling, or
upon any other elevated spot from which the bearings have
been taken, he will be able to inform his young friends that
such and such a place lies in such a direction, that this place
lies due north, the other north-west, a third south-east, the
fourth south-west, etc., etc.</p>


<h3>INTERESTING PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE MAGNET.</h3>

<p>Fire-irons which have rested in an upright position in a
room during the summer months are often highly magnetic.</p>

<p>Iron bars standing erect, such as the gratings of a prison
cell, or the iron railings before houses, are often magnetic.</p>

<p>Great iron-clad ships are powerfully magnetic, and therefore
affect the compass by which the vessel is steered; ingenious
arrangements are therefore made to correct the effect
of the local attraction, so that the man-of-war may be steered
correctly.</p>

<p>Magnetism may be made to pass through a deal board; to
exhibit which, lay a needle on the smooth part above, and
run a magnet along the under side, and the needle will be<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
found to follow the course of the magnet. A magnet dipped
into boiling water loses part of its magnetism, which, however,
returns upon its cooling.</p>

<p>A sudden blow given to a magnet often destroys its magnetic
power.</p>

<p>Associated with the use of iodine and bromine is an art
which every intelligent boy may practice, if he will attend to
the following precise details kindly furnished by an experienced
photographer.</p>


<h3>HOW TO MAKE THE NEGATIVE ON GLASS, USING COLLODION
BROMOIODIZED FOR IRON DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p>1. The edges of the glass should be ground all round, also
slightly on the surface of the edges. This prevents contraction
of the film, enabling it to resist the action of a heavy
stream of water. Mark one side in the corner with a diamond,
and upon this side bestow the greatest care.</p>

<p>2. <em>To clean the glass, if new.</em>—Make a mixture of spirits of
wine and solution of ammonia, equal parts; render it as thick
as cream with tripoli; with a piece of cotton-wool kept for this
purpose rub a small quantity over that side marked as described,
wash well under a tap of water, and wipe dry with a
piece of old linen, washed without soap, and kept scrupulously
clean for this purpose. Plates should not, however, be
cleaned in the operating room with the above mixture; the
vapor of ammonia might prove injurious to the chemicals.</p>

<p>3. Now polish with an old white silk handkerchief. If this
latter precaution be not taken, small particles of linen will be
left upon the plate: these are perhaps only seen when draining
off the collodion; they form nuclei and eddies, checking
the collodion in its course. Some of these minute fibers are
washed off, and contaminate the next picture. To all lovers
of clean pictures our advice therefore is, having well dried the
plate with old linen, lay it, clean side upwards, upon a few
sheets of common glazed demy paper (not blotting), and rub
it hard with the silk until sensibly warm; this has the double
advantage of dispersing fibers and moisture, for all glass
plates are slightly in a hygrometric condition. Double the
silk rubber up to form a pad, and with this the glass must be
firmly dusted down just before pouring on the collodion, which<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
will then run most evenly; if the coated plate is now viewed
by transmitted light, not a speck or blemish will be seen upon
it. When a plate cleaned as above described is breathed upon,
the moisture does not evaporate slowly, but <em>flies off</em>. Do not
be afraid of putting the glass into an electrical condition with
the silk rubber; on this account objections have been raised
to the use of silk; practically, however, I find it a most valuable
auxiliary in this starting-point of the process, the perfect
manipulation of which makes an important difference in the
value of the finished picture. What can be more inartistic
and annoying to an educated eye than spots, patches, stars,
and sky-rockets, the forms and shapes of which rival, in numberless
variety, a display of fireworks? Let us not, therefore,
be contented with pictures, however good in other respects,
presenting these deformities—so many blots on the photographic
escutcheon.</p>

<p><em>To clean a glass after having used it, when not varnished.</em>—Wash
off the collodion film with water, then clean the marked
side with plain tripoli and water, and dry as above.</p>

<p><em>To coat the plate.</em>—First remove all the particles of dried
collodion from the mouth of the bottle. Now pour upon the
center of the cleaned glass as much collodion as it will hold.
Do not perform this operation hurriedly, take time, and systematically
incline the plate in such a manner that the collodion
may run into each corner in succession; when perfectly
covered, pour off gently the excess into the bottle at one of
the corners nearest to you; with observation and practice
dexterity is easily acquired. There are many ways of coating
the plate; each person will adopt that which practice teaches
him is best. The pneumatic plate-holder is a convenient little
instrument to use for holding the plate whilst pouring on the
collodion; it may be used for both small and large plates.</p>

<p>Keep the corner of the glass plate in contact with the neck
of the bottle whilst pouring off the collodion; otherwise the
film will be wavy in places.</p>

<p>4. As soon as the collodion ceases to run, plunge the prepared
glass gently, without stopping, into the nitrate of silver
bath, which is prepared as follows: Into a 20-oz. stoppered
bottle put nitrate of silver, <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span></span> ozs.; distilled water, 4 ozs.;
dissolve. To this solution add iodide of potassium, 4 grs.,
dissolved in one drachm of distilled water. Mix these two
solutions; the precipitate (iodide of silver) thus formed is by
shaking entirely dissolved. Add 16 ozs. of distilled water,
when the excess of iodide of silver is again thrown down, but
in such a finely divided state as to render the saturation of
the bath with iodide of silver perfect. Now drop in sufficient
of the oxide of silver to turn the turbid yellow solution a dirty<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
brown color; so long as this effect is produced the quantity of
oxide of silver, however much in excess, is of no consequence;
shake the bottle well for ten minutes or so at intervals; then
add alcohol, 30 minims, and filter; to the filtered solution add
dilute nitric acid of the strength stated, 5 minims. The bath
is now ready for use, and should be quite neutral.</p>

<p>5. Allow the prepared glass to remain in this bath from five
to ten minutes, according to the temperature. Move it up
and down three or four times whilst in the bath, in order to
get rid of the greasy appearance on the surface; drain it, but
not too closely. When in the frame, place upon the back a
piece of common blotting-paper, to absorb moisture, and the
two lower silver wires should also be covered with slips of
blotting-paper; after which the sooner it is placed in the
camera the better.</p>

<p>6. The time of exposure can only be ascertained by practice—no
rules can be laid down; and I am unacquainted with
any royal road, but that of experience, leading to constant
success in this most important point.</p>

<p>7. The plate having been taken from the camera and placed
upon a leveled stand, or held in the hand, develop immediately
the latent image with the following solution:</p>

<p><em>Iron developing solution.</em>—Protosulphate of iron, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oz.;
glacial acetic acid, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oz.; spirits of wine, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span> oz.; distilled
water, 8 ozs.; mix. Pour on of this solution only enough to
cover the plate easily, commencing at that edge of the negative
which stood uppermost in the camera; move the solution
to and fro until it has become intimately mixed with the silver
on the plate; then pour off into the developing glass, and <em>at
once</em> return it on to the plate. When as much intensity has
been obtained as possible with the iron developer, it should be
thoroughly removed by washing with water. Any intensity
may be obtained afterwards by using either of the following
solutions:</p>

<p>8. <em>Intensifying solution.</em>—Pyrogallic acid, 6 grs.; glacial
acetic acid, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oz.; distilled water, 6 ozs.; mix. A few drops
of a 30-gr. solution of nitrate of silver, the quantity to be
regulated according to the intensity required, to be added, at
the moment of using, to as much of the pyrogallic solution as
may be necessary.</p>

<p><em>Intensifying solution</em> (another form).—1. Pyrogallic acid,
8 grs.; citric acid, 20 grs.; distilled water, 2 ozs. 2. Nitrate
of silver, 8 grs.; distilled water, 2 ozs. Mix small quantities
of the solutions 1 and 2, in equal portions, the moment
before using.</p>

<p>The pyrogallic solution, made with good acetic acid, may
be kept for a month or more in a cool place. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
if the conditions of light and situation are unfavorable, I
should prefer this solution just made. The iron solutions act
best when freshly prepared.</p>

<p>It is supposed by some that a prolonged action of the iron
developer produces fogginess. This may be the case when
impure or improperly prepared collodion is used, but certainly
not when the preparation is pure and of the proper quality.</p>

<p>When the image is sufficiently intense, wash freely with
common filtered water; then pour on a saturated solution of
hyposulphate of soda, which should immediately remove the
iodide of silver: wash again well with water; allow as much
as the plate will hold to soak in for at least a quarter of an
hour, changing the water occasionally, to remove all traces
of hyposulphate; lastly, wash the plate with a little distilled
water, stand up to dry, and, if required, varnish either with
spirit or amber varnish.</p>

<p>The following solution is also very commonly used for fixing
the negative:—Cyanide of potassium, <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">4</span> oz.; water,
12 ozs.</p>

<p>Attention to the following rules and cautions will assist the
operator in the production of perfect pictures:—</p>

<p>1. Do not disturb the deposit which will occasionally be
found at the bottom of the bottle containing the collodion.</p>

<p>2. Remove all particles of dried film from the neck of the
bottle before pouring the collodion on the plate.</p>

<p>3. Never use damp cloths, leathers, or buffs, for giving the
final polish to the plate. Negatives with an indistinct and
muddy surface are frequently produced from this cause.</p>

<p>4. Let the film set properly before immersion in the nitrate
of silver bath: its condition can be ascertained by gently
touching the lower part of the coated plate with the end of
the finger.</p>

<p>5. Never omit to pass a broad camel-hair brush over the
plate just before pouring on the collodion.</p>

<p>6. Bear in mind that, as light is the producing agent, so
will it prove a destructive one: not less than four folds of
yellow calico should be used to obstruct white light; and in
that case the aperture covered should be no larger than is
necessary to admit sufficient light for working by. Examine
occasionally the yellow calico: when this material is used to
exclude white light, it becomes bleached by constant exposure.
Do not trust alone to any colored glass; no glass yet made is
anti-actinic under all aspects of light and conditions of exposure.</p>

<p>7. When the negative requires intensifying, carefully wash
off all traces of the first developing solution before proceeding<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
to intensify. This operation may be performed either before
or after the iodide is removed by fixing.</p>

<p>8. Glass baths are preferable to porcelain, ebonite, or
gutta-percha baths for solution of nitrate of silver.</p>

<p>9. In using either spirit or amber varnish, before pouring it
off, keep the plate horizontal a few seconds. This gives time
for soaking in, and prevents the formation of a dull surface
arising from too thin a coating.</p>

<p>10. Rub the lenses occasionally with a soft and clean wash-leather,
the rapidity of action is much influenced by the brightness
of the lenses: their surfaces are constantly affected by
moisture in the atmosphere, which condensing, destroys the
brilliancy of the image.</p>

<p>11. The white blotting-paper used for some photographic
purposes is not suitable for filtering solutions; that only
should be employed which is made for this purpose, and is
sold under the name of filtering-paper.</p>

<p>12. <em>Hyposulphate of soda.</em>—A great deal of rubbish is sold
under the name of this salt. As a test of its quality, <span class="nowrap">1 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>
drachms should entirely dissolve in 1 drachm of water, and this
solution should dissolve rather more than <span class="nowrap">4 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span> grains of
iodide of silver.</p>

<p>13. <em>Chemicals.</em>—The purity of photographic chemicals cannot
be too strongly urged; the cheapest are not always the
most economical. The commercial preparations are generally
not to be depended upon, as these, though perhaps unadulterated,
are, strictly speaking, not chemically pure. It is
best to procure them from well-known chemists, who understand
the purpose for which they are intended, and make the
preparation of these substances peculiarly a branch of their
business.</p>

<p>14. Never leave chemical solutions exposed in dishes: when
done with, pour them back into glass-stoppered bottles, and
decant for use from any deposit, or filter if necessary.</p>

<p>15. In all photographic processes it is absolutely necessary
to be chemically clean; and this sometimes is not easy. As
a rule, never be satisfied with cleanly appearances only, but
take such measures as shall insure the absence of all extraneous
matter in preparing the solutions, cleaning the glasses,
dishes, etc.</p>

<p>16. All stains on the hands, linen, etc., may be removed
by means of cyanogen soap or cyanide of potassium, which
should be applied without water at first, then thoroughly
washed off. To assist the operation, the hands may be now
gently rubbed with a fine piece of pumice-stone, when the
stains quickly disappear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MECHANICS">MECHANICS.</h2>
</div>


<p>There is no subject of such importance as Mechanics, as its
principles are founded upon the properties of matter and the
laws of motion; and in knowing something of these, the tyro
will lay the foundation of all substantial knowledge.</p>

<p>The properties of matter are the following: Solidity (or Impenetrability),
Divisibility, Mobility, Elasticity, Brittleness,
Malleability, Ductility, and Tenacity.</p>

<p>The laws of motion are as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Every body continues in a state of rest or of uniform
rectilineal motion, unless affected by some extraneous force.</p>

<p>2. The change of motion is always proportionate to the impelling
force.</p>

<p>3. Action and reaction are always equal and contrary.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENT OF THE LAW OF MOTION.</h3>

<p>In shooting at “taw,” if the marble be struck “plump,” as
it is called, it moves forward exactly in the same line of direction;
but if struck sideways, it will move in an oblique
direction, and its course will be in a line situated between the
direction of its former motion and that of the force impressed.
This is called the resolution of forces.</p>


<h3>BALANCING.</h3>

<p>The center of gravity in a body is that part about which all
the other parts equally balance each other. In balancing a
stick upon the finger, or upon the chin, it is necessary only to
keep the chin or finger exactly under the point which is called
the center of gravity.</p>


<h3>THE PRANCING HORSE.</h3>

<p>Cut out the figure of a horse, and having fixed a curved iron
wire to the under part of its body, place a small ball of lead
upon it. Place the hind legs of the horse on the table, and
it will rock to and fro. If the ball be removed, the horse
would immediately tumble, because unsupported, the center
of gravity being in the front of the prop; but upon the ball
being replaced, the center of gravity immediately changes<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
as position, and is brought under the prop, and the horse is
again in equilibrio.</p>


<h3>TO CONSTRUCT A FIGURE, WHICH BEING PLACED UPON A
CURVED SURFACE, AND INCLINED IN ANY POSITION,
SHALL, WHEN LEFT TO ITSELF, RETURN TO ITS FORMER
POSITION.</h3>

<p>The feet of the figure rest on a curved pivot, which is sustained
by two loaded balls below; for the weight of these balls
being much greater than that of the figure, their effect is to
bring the center of gravity of the whole beneath the point on
which it rests; consequently the equilibrium will resist any
slight force to disturb it.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A CARRIAGE RUN IN AN INVERTED POSITION
WITHOUT FALLING.</h3>

<p>It is pretty well known to most boys, that if a tumbler of
water be placed within a broad wooden hoop, the whole may
be whirled round without falling, owing to the centrifugal
force. On the same principle, if a small carriage be placed on
an iron band or rail, it will ascend the curve, become inverted,
and descend again, without falling.</p>


<h3>TO CAUSE A CYLINDER TO ROLL BY ITS OWN WEIGHT
UP-HILL.</h3>

<p>Procure a coffee-canister, and loading it with a piece of
lead, which may be fixed in with solder, the position of the
center of gravity is thus altered. If a cylinder so constructed
be placed on an inclined plane, and the loaded part above, it
will roll up-hill without assistance.</p>


<h3>THE BALANCED STICK.</h3>

<p>Procure a piece of wood, about nine inches in length, and
about half an inch in thickness, and thrust into its upper end
the blades of two pen-knives, on either side one. Place the
other end upon the tip of the fore-finger, and it will keep its
place without falling.</p>


<h3>THE CHINESE MANDARIN.</h3>

<p>Construct out of the pith of the elder a little mandarin;
then provide a base for it to sit in, like a kettle drum. Into
this put some heavy substance, such as half a leaden bullet;
fasten the figure to this, and in whatever position it may be
placed, it will, when left to itself, immediately return to its
upright position.</p>


<h3>TO MAKE A SHILLING TURN ON ITS EDGE ON THE POINT OF
A NEEDLE.</h3>

<p>Take a bottle, with a cork in its neck, and place in it, in a
perpendicular position, a middle-sized needle. Fix a shilling<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
into another cork, by cutting a nick in it; and stick into the
same cork two small table-forks, opposite each other, with
the handles inclining outwards and downwards. If the rim of
the shilling be now poised on the point of the needle, it may
easily be made to spin round without falling, as the center of
gravity is below the center of suspension.</p>


<h3>THE DANCING PEA.</h3>

<p>If you stick through a pea, or small ball of pith, two pins at
right angles and defend the points with pieces of sealing-wax,
it may be kept in equilibrio at a short distance from the
end of a straight tube, by means of a current of breath from
the mouth, which imparts a rotary motion to the pea.</p>


<h3>OBLIQUITY OF MOTION.</h3>

<p>Cut a piece of pasteboard into a circular shape, and describe
on it a spiral line; cut this out with a pen-knife, and
then suspend it on a large skewer or pin. If the whole be now
placed on a warm stove, or over the flame of a candle or
lamp, it will revolve with considerable velocity. The card,
after being cut into the spiral, may be made to represent a
snake or dragon, and when in motion will produce a very
pleasing effect.</p>

and its various phenomena is called Pneumatics. By it we
learn many curious particulars. By it we find that the air has
weight and pressure, color, density, elasticity, compressibility,
and some other properties with which we shall endeavor to
make the young reader acquainted by many pleasing experiments,
earnestly impressing upon him to lose no opportunity
of making physical science his study.</p>

<p>The common leather sucker by which boys raise stones will
show the pressure of the atmosphere. It consists of a piece
of soft but firm leather having a piece of string drawn through
its center. The leather is made quite wet and pliable, and
then its under part is placed on the stone and stamped down
by the foot. This pressing excludes the air from between the
leather and the stone, and by pulling the string a vacuum is<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
left underneath its center; consequently the leather is firmly
attached to the stone, which enables you to lift it.</p>


<h3>WEIGHT OF THE AIR PROVED BY A PAIR OF BELLOWS.</h3>

<p>Shut the nozzle and valve-hole of a pair of bellows, and after
having squeezed the air out of them, if they are perfectly
air-tight, we shall find that a very great force, even some hundreds
of pounds, is necessary for separating the boards. They
are kept together by the weight of the air which surrounds
them in the same manner as if they were surrounded by
water.</p>


<h3>THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR SHOWN BY A WINE-GLASS.</h3>

<p>Place a card on a wine-glass filled with water, then invert
the glass; the water will not escape, the pressure of the atmosphere
on the outside of the card being sufficient to support
the water.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER.</h3>

<p>Invert a tall glass jar in a dish of water, and place a lighted
taper under it; as the taper consumes the air in the jar, the
water, from the pressure without, <em>rises up</em> to supply the place
of the oxygen removed by the combustion. In the operation
of cupping the operator holds the flame of a lamp under a bell-shaped
glass. The air within this being rarefied and expanded,
a considerable portion is given off. In this state the glass
is placed upon the flesh, and as the air within it cools it contracts,
and the glass adheres to the flesh by the difference of
the pressure of the internal and external air.</p>


<h3>ELASTICITY OF THE AIR.</h3>

<p>This can be shown by a beautiful philosophical toy, which
may easily be constructed. Procure a glass jar and put water
into it. Then mold three or four little figures in wax, and
make them hollow within, and having each a minute opening
at the heel, by which water may pass in and out. Place
them in the jar, and adjust them by the quantity of water
admitted to them, so that in specific gravity they differ a
little from each other. The mouth of the jar should now be
covered with a piece of skin or india-rubber, and then, if
the hand be pressed upon the top or mouth of the jar, the
figures will be seen to rise or descend as the pressure is gentle
or heavy; rising and falling or standing still, according
to the pressure made.</p>


<h3>REASON FOR THIS.</h3>

<p>The reason of this is, that the pressure on the top of the jar
condenses the air between the cover and the water surface;<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
this condensation then presses on the water below, and influences
it through its whole extent, compressing also the air
in the figures, forcing as much more water into them as to
render them heavier than water, and therefore heavy enough
to sink.</p>


<h3>THE AIR-PUMP.</h3>

<p>The time was, and that not very long ago, when the air-pump
was only obtainable by the philosophical professor or
by persons of enlarged means. But now, owing to our “cheap
way of doing things,” a small air-pump may be obtained for
about $5, and we would strongly advise our young friends
to procure one, as it will be a source of endless amusement to
them; and, supposing that they take our advice, we suggest
the following experiments.</p>

<p>The air-pump consists of a bell glass, called the receiver,
and a stand upon which is a perforated plate. The hole in
this plate is connected with two pistons, the rods of which
are moved by a wheel handle backwards and forwards, and
thus pumps the air out of the receiver. When the air is thus
taken out, a stop-cock is turned, and then the experiments
may be performed.</p>

<p>Under the receiver of an air-pump, when the air has been
thoroughly exhausted, light and heavy bodies fall with the
same swiftness. Animals quickly die for want of air, combustion
ceases, a bell sounds faint, and water and other fluids
change to vapor.</p>


<h3>TO PROVE THAT AIR HAS WEIGHT.</h3>

<p>Take a florence flask, fitted up with a screw and fine oiled
silk valve. Screw the flask on the plate of the air-pump, exhaust
the air, take it off the plate, and weigh it. Then let in
the air, and again weigh the whole, and it will be found to
have increased by several grains.</p>


<h3>TO PROVE AIR ELASTIC.</h3>

<p>Place a bladder out of which all the air has apparently been
squeezed under the receiver, upon it lay a weight, exhaust the
air, and it will be seen that the small quantity of air left
within the bladder will so expand itself as to lift the weight.
Put a corked bottle into the receiver, exhaust the air, and the
cork will fly out.</p>


<h3>SOVEREIGN AND FEATHER.</h3>

<p>Place a nicely-adjusted pair of forceps at the top of the receiver,
communicating with the top of the outside through a
hole, so that they may be opened by the fingers. Then place
on each of the little plates a <em>sovereign</em> and a <em>feather</em>. Exhaust<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
the air from the receiver: and having done so, detach the
objects, so that they may fall. In the open air the sovereign
will fall long before the feather, but in vacuo, as in the receiver
now exhausted of its air, they will fall both together, and
reach the bottom of the glass at the same instant.</p>


<h3>AIR IN THE EGG.</h3>

<p>Take a fresh egg, and cut off a little of the shell and film
from its smaller end; then put the egg under a receiver, and
pump out the air; upon which all the contents of the egg will
be forced out by the expansion of the small bubble of air contained
in the great end between the shell and the film.</p>


<h3>THE DESCENDING SMOKE.</h3>

<p>Set a lighted candle on the plate, and cover it with a tall
receiver. The candle will continue to burn while the air
remains, but when exhausted, will go out, and the smoke
from the wick, instead of rising, will descend in dense clouds
towards the bottom of the glass, because the air which would
have supported it has been withdrawn.</p>


<h3>THE SOUNDLESS BELL.</h3>

<p>Set a bell on the pump-plate, having a contrivance so as to
ring it at pleasure, and cover it with a receiver; then make
the clapper sound against the bell, and it will be heard to
sound very well; now exhaust the receiver of air, and then
when the clapper strikes against the sides of the bell the sound
can be scarcely heard.</p>


<h3>THE FLOATING FISH.</h3>

<p>If a glass vessel containing water, in which a couple of fish
are put, be placed under the receiver, upon exhausting the
air the fish will be unable to keep at the bottom of the glass
owing to the expansion of the air within their bodies, contained
in the air bladder. They will consequently rise and
float, belly upwards, upon the surface of the water.</p>


<h3>THE DIVING BELL.</h3>

<p>The diving bell is a pneumatic engine, by means of which
persons can descend to great depths in the sea, and recover
from it valuable portions of wrecks and other things. Its
principle may be well illustrated by the following experiment.
Take a glass tumbler, and plunge it into the water with the<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
mouth downwards, and it will be found that the water will not
rise much more than half way in the tumbler. This may be
made very evident if a piece of cork be suffered to float inside the
glass on the surface of the water. The air within the tumbler
does not entirely exclude the water, because air is elastic, and
consequently compressible, and hence the air in the tumbler
is what is called condensed. The diving bell is formed upon
the above principle; but instead of being glass it is a wooden
or metal vessel, of very large dimensions, so as to hold three
or four persons, who are supplied with air from above by
means of powerful pumps, whilst the excess of air escapes at
the bottom of the bell.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENTS.</h3>

<p>1. Place a cylinder of strong glass, open at both ends, on
the plate of the air-pump, and put your hand on the other end,
and you will of course be able to remove it at pleasure. Now
exhaust the air from the interior of the cylinder, and at each
stroke of the pump you will feel your hand pressed tighter and
tighter on the cylinder, until you will not be able to remove
it: as soon as the air is again admitted to the interior of the
cylinder, the pressure within will be restored, and the hand
again be at liberty.</p>

<p>2. Tie a piece of moistened bladder very firmly over one end
of a similar glass cylinder, and place the open end on the plate
of the pump. As soon as you begin to exhaust the air from
the interior, the bladder, which was previously quite horizontal,
will begin to bulge inwards, the concavity increasing
as the exhaustion proceeds, until the bladder, no longer able
to bear the weight of the superincumbent air, breaks with a
loud report.</p>

<p>3. The elasticity of air, or indeed of any gaseous body, may
be shown by introducing under the air-pump receiver a bladder
containing a very small quantity of air, its mouth being
closely tied. As you exhaust the air from the receiver, that
portion contained in the bladder being no longer pressed
upon by the atmosphere, will gradually expand, distending
the bladder until it appears nearly full: on readmitting the
air into the receiver, the bladder will at once shrink to its
former dimensions.</p>

<p>A shriveled apple placed under the same conditions will
appear plump when the air is removed from the receiver, and
resume its former appearance on the readmission of the air.</p>

<p>4. There is a very pretty apparatus made for the purpose
of showing the pressure of the atmosphere, consisting of a
hollow globe of brass, about three inches in diameter, divided<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
into two equal parts, which fit very accurately together. It
is furnished with two handles; one of them screwed into a
hollow stem, communicating with the interior of the globe,
and fitting on to the air-pump; the other is attached to a
short stem on the opposite side of the globe. In the natural
state the globe may easily be separated into its two hemispheres
by one person pulling the handles, but after the air
has been exhausted from the interior it requires two very
strong men to separate the parts, and they will often fail to
do so. By turning the stop-cock, and readmitting the air
into the interior of the globe, it will come asunder as easily as
at first.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the weight of the atmosphere for the
power we possess of raising water by the common pump; for
the piston of the pump withdrawing the air from the interior
of the pipe, which terminates in water, the pressure of the
atmosphere forces the water up the pipe to supply the place
of the air withdrawn. It was soon found, however, that when
the column of water in the pipe was more than thirty feet
high, the pump became useless, for the water refused to rise
higher. Why? It was found that a column of water about
thirty feet high exerted a pressure equal to the weight of the
atmosphere, thus establishing an equilibrium between the
water in the pipe and the atmospheric pressure.</p>

<p>This is the principle on which the barometer, or <em>measurer
of weight</em>, as its name imports, is constructed. The metal
Mercury is about thirteen and a half times heavier than water;
consequently, if a column of water thirty <em>feet</em> high balances
the pressure of the atmosphere, a column of mercury thirty
<em>inches</em> high ought to do also—and this is in fact the case. If
you take a glass tube nearly three feet long, and closed at one
end, and fill it with mercury; then, placing your finger on the
open end, invert the tube into a basin or saucer containing
some of the same metal; upon removing your finger (which
must be done carefully, while the mouth of the tube is completely
covered by the mercury), it will be seen that the fluid
will fall a few inches, leaving the upper part of the tube
empty. Such a tube with a graduated scale attached is in
truth a barometer, and as the weight of the atmosphere
increases or decreases, so the mercury rises or falls in the
tube. This instrument is of the greatest value to the seaman,
for a sudden fall of the barometer will often give notice of an
impending storm when all is fine and calm, and thus enable
the mariner to make the preparations necessary to meet the
danger.</p>

<p>It was discovered by an Italian philosopher named Torricelli,
and from him the vacuum formed in the upper end of<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
the tube above the surface of the mercury has been called the
Torricellian vacuum. It is by far the most perfect vacuum
that can be obtained, containing necessarily nothing but a
minute quantity of the vapor of mercury.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>Pass a little ether through the mercury in the tube, and as
soon as it reaches the empty space it will boil violently,
depressing the mercury, until the pressure of its own vapor is
sufficient to prevent its ebullition. If you now cool the upper
part of the tube, so as to condense the vapor, the pressure
being thus removed, the ether will again begin to boil, and so
alternately, as often as you please. In order to show this
fact with effect, the bore of the tube should not be less than
half an inch in diameter.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>To show that the heat abstracted by the boiling of one
liquid will freeze another, fill a tall narrow glass about half
full of cold water (the colder the better), and place in it a
thin glass tube containing some ether. Put them under the
receiver of an air-pump. As you exhaust the air, the ether
will begin to boil, until at length, by continuing the exhaustion,
the water immediately surrounding the tube of ether
will freeze, and a tolerably large piece of ice may thus be
obtained.</p>

<p>Ether evaporates so rapidly even under the pressure of the
atmosphere, that a small animal, such as a mouse, may be
actually frozen to death by constantly dropping ether upon it.
If poured on the hand, it produces a degree of cold that soon
becomes, to say the least, unpleasant.</p>


<h3>EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>Place a flat saucer containing about a pound of oil of vitriol
under the receiver of the air-pump, and set in it a watch glass
containing a little water, supported on a stand with <em>glass</em> legs.
Exhaust the receiver, when the water will evaporate, but
without boiling; and the vapor being absorbed as it forms by
the oil of vitriol, the vacuum is preserved, and the evaporation
continues, until the vapor has abstracted so much caloric
from the remainder of the water that it is all at once converted
into ice.</p>

<p>In most elementary works on chemistry may be found a
long table of freezing mixtures, as they are called, some with<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
and others without ice or snow. We have selected a few
from each division.</p>

<p>The effects of most of these mixtures may be considerably
increased by previously cooling the ingredients <em>separately</em>
in other freezing mixtures.</p>

<p>In connection with this branch of science, and especially
with chemistry, the youthful philosopher should practice the
art of decanting air from one jar to another standing over
water, beginning by passing it from a small to a larger jar,
then with two of equal size; and when he can accomplish the
transfer without permitting even one bubble to escape, he
may essay the much more difficult task of transferring the air
from a large to a smaller jar.</p>

<p>He should also practice using the blowpipe until he can
keep up a steady and uninterrupted flame for ten minutes or
a quarter of an hour, without stopping for breath. It is
quite possible to replenish <em>wind</em> in the mouth, which alone
ought to be used, without interrupting the breathing for an
instant, but it requires some practice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOW_TO_BECOME_AN_OPTICIAN">HOW TO BECOME AN OPTICIAN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Optics is the science of <em>light</em> and <em>vision</em>. Concerning the
nature of light, two theories are at present very ably maintained<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
by their respective advocates. One is termed the
Newtonian theory, and the other the Huygenean. The Newtonian
theory considers light to consist of inconceivably small
bodies emanating from the sun, or any other luminous body.
The Huygenean conceives it to consist in the undulations of a
highly elastic and subtle fluid, propagated round luminous
centers in spherical waves, like those arising in a placid lake
when a stone is dropped into the water.</p>


<h3>LIGHT AS AN EFFECT.</h3>

<p>Light follows the same laws as gravity, and its intensity or
degree decreases as the square of the distance from the luminous
body increases. Thus, at the distance of two yards
from a candle we shall have four times less light than we
should have were we only one yard from it, and so on in the
same proportion.</p>


<h3>REFRACTION.</h3>

<p>Bodies which suffer the rays of light to pass through them,
such as air, water, or glass, are called refracting media.
When rays of light enter these, they do not proceed in straight
lines, but are said to be refracted, or bent out of their course.
But if the ray falls perpendicularly on the glass, there is no
refraction, and it proceeds in a direct line; hence, refraction
only takes place when rays fall obliquely or aslant on the
media.</p>


<h3>THE INVISIBLE COIN MADE VISIBLE.</h3>

<p>If a coin be placed in a basin, so that on standing at a certain
distance it be just hid from the eye of an observer by the
rim or edge of the basin, and then water be poured in by
a second person, the first keeping his position; as the water
rises the coin will become visible, and will appear to have
moved from the side to the middle of the basin.</p>


<h3>THE MULTIPLYING GLASS.</h3>

<p>The multiplying glass is a semicircular piece of glass cut into
facets or distinct surfaces; and in looking through it we have
an illustration of the laws of refraction, for if a small object,
such as a fly, be placed at the further end, a person will see as
many flies as there are surfaces or facets on the glass.</p>


<h3>TRANSPARENT BODIES.</h3>

<p>Transparent bodies, such as glass, may be made of such
form as to cause all the rays which pass through them from
any given point to meet in any other given point beyond them,
or which will disperse them from the given point. These are<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
called lenses, and have different names according to their
form. 1. Is called the plano-convex lens. 2. Plano-concave.
3. Double convex. 4. Double concave. 5. A meniscus, so
called from its resembling the crescent moon.</p>


<h3>THE PRISM.</h3>

<p>The prism is a triangular solid of glass, and by it the young
optician may decompose a ray of light into its primitive and
supplementary colors, for a ray of light is of a compound nature.
By the prism the ray is divided into its three primitive
colors, blue, red, and yellow; and their four supplementary
ones, violet, indigo, green, and orange. The best way to
perform this experiment is to cut a small slit in a window-shutter,
on which the sun shines at some period of the day,
and directly opposite the hole place a prism; a beam of light
in passing through it will then be decomposed, and if let fall
upon a sheet of white paper, or against a white wall, the seven
colors of the rainbow will be observed.</p>


<h3>COMPOSITION OF LIGHT.</h3>

<p>The beam of light passing through the prism is decomposed,
and the spaces occupied by the colors are in the
following proportions: Red, 6; orange, 4; yellow, 7; green,
8; blue, 8; indigo, 6; violet, 11. Now, if you paste a sheet
of white paper on a circular piece of board about six inches in
diameter, and divide it with a pencil into fifty parts, and
paint colors in them in the proportions given above, painting
them dark in the center parts, and gradually fainter at the
edges, till they blend with the one adjoining. If the board be
then fixed to an axle, and made to revolve quickly, the colors
will no longer appear separate and distinct, but becoming
gradually less visible they will ultimately appear <em>white</em>, giving
this appearance to the whole surface of the paper.</p>


<h3>A NATURAL CAMERA OBSCURA.</h3>

<p>The human eye is a camera obscura, for on the back of it
on the retina every object in a landscape is beautifully depicted
in miniature. This may be proved by the</p>


<h3>BULLOCK’S EYE EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p>Procure a fresh bullock’s eye from the butcher, and carefully
thin the outer coat of it behind: take care not to cut it,
for if this should be done the vitreous humor will escape, and
the experiment cannot be performed. Having so prepared
the eye, if the pupil of it be directed to any bright objects, they
will appear distinctly delineated on the back part precisely as
objects appear in the instrument we are about to describe.<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
The effect will be heightened if the eye is viewed in a dark
room with a small hole in the shutter, but in every case the
appearance will be very striking.</p>


<h3>THE CAMERA OBSCURA.</h3>

<p>This is a very pleasing and instructive optical apparatus,
and it may be easily made by the young optician. Procure an
oblong box, about two feet long, twelve inches wide, and
eight high. In one end of this a tube must be fitted containing
a lens, and be made to slide backwards and forwards so
as to suit the focus. Within the box should be a plain mirror
reclining backwards from the tube at an angle of forty-five
degrees. At the top of the box is a square of unpolished
glass, upon which from beneath the picture will be thrown,
and may be seen by raising the lid. To use the camera place
the tube with the lens on it opposite to the object, and having
adjusted the focus, the image will be thrown upon the ground-glass
as above stated, where it may be easily copied by a pencil
or in colors.</p>

<p>The camera obscura used in a public exhibition is a large
wooden box stained black in the inside, and capable of containing
from one to eight persons. It contains a sliding piece, having
a sloping mirror and a double convex lens which may
with the mirror be slid up or down so as to accommodate the
lens to near and distant objects. When the rays proceeding
from an object without fall upon the mirror they are reflected
upon the lens, and brought to fall on the bottom of the box,
or upon a table placed horizontally to receive them, which
may be seen by the spectator.</p>


<h3>THE MAGIC LANTERN.</h3>

<p>This is one of the most pleasing of all optical instruments,
and it is used to produce enlarged pictures of objects, which
being painted on a glass in various colors are thrown upon
a screen or white sheet placed against the wall of a large
room. It consists of a sort of tin box, within which is a lamp,
the light of which passes through a great plano-convex lens
fixed in the front. This strongly illuminates the objects
which are painted on the slides or slips of glass, and placed
before the lens in an inverted position, and the rays passing
through them and the lens fall on a sheet or other white surface,
placed to receive the image. The glasses on which the
figures are drawn are inverted, in order that the images of
them may be erect.</p>


<h3>PAINTING THE SLIDES.</h3>

<p>The slides containing the objects usually shown in a magic
lantern, are to be bought at opticians with the lantern, and<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
can be procured cheaper and better in this way than by any
attempt at manufacturing them. Should, however, the young
optician wish to make a few slides of objects of particular
interest to himself, he may proceed as follows:</p>

<p>Draw first on paper the figures you wish to paint, lay it on
the table, and cover it over with a piece of glass of the above
shape; now draw the outlines with a fine camel’s hair pencil
in black paint mixed with varnish, and when this is dry fill
up the other parts with the proper colors, shading with bister
also mixed with varnish. The transparent colors are alone to
be used in this kind of painting.</p>


<h3>TO EXHIBIT THE MAGIC LANTERN.</h3>

<p>The room for the exhibition ought to be large, and of an
oblong shape. At one end of it suspend a large sheet so as to
cover the whole of the wall. The company being all seated,
darken the room, and placing the lantern with its tube in the
direction of the sheet, introduce one of the slides into the slit,
taking care to invert the figures; then adjust the focus of the
glasses in the tube by drawing it in or out as required, and a
perfect representation of the object will appear.</p>


<h3>EFFECTS OF THE MAGIC LANTERN.</h3>

<p>Most extraordinary effects may be produced by means of the
magic lantern; one of the most effective of which is a</p>


<h3>TEMPEST AT SEA.</h3>

<p>This is effected by having two slides painted, one with the
tempest as approaching on one side, and continuing in intensity
till it reaches the other. Another slide has ships painted
on it, and while the lantern is in use, that containing the ships
is dexterously drawn before the other, and represents <em>ships in
the storm</em>.</p>

<p>The effects of sunrise, moonlight, starlight, etc., may be
imitated also, by means of double slides, and figures may be
introduced sometimes of <em>fearful</em> proportions.</p>

<p>Heads may be made to nod, faces to laugh; eyes may be
made to roll, teeth to gnash; crocodiles may be made to swallow
tigers; combats may be represented; but one of the most
instructive uses of the slides is to make them illustrative of
astronomy, and to show the rotation of the seasons, the cause
of eclipses, the mountains in the moon, spots on the sun, and
the various motions of the planetary bodies, and their satellites.</p>


<h3>THE PHANTASMAGORIA.</h3>

<p>Between the phantasmagoria and the magic lantern there
is this difference: in common magic lanterns the figures are<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
painted on transparent glass, consequently the image on the
screen is a circle of light having figures upon it; but in the
phantasmagoria all the glass is made opaque, except the figures,
which, being painted in transparent colors, the light
shines through them, and no light can come upon the screen
except that which passes through the figure.</p>

<p>There is no sheet to receive the picture, but the representation
is thrown on a thin screen of silk or muslin placed between
<em>the spectators and the lantern</em>. The images are made to appear
approaching and receding by removing it further from
the screen, or bringing it nearer to it. This is a great advantage
over the ordinary arrangements of the magic lantern,
and by it the most astonishing effects are often produced.</p>


<h3>DISSOLVING VIEWS.</h3>

<p>The dissolving views, by which one landscape or scene appears
to pass into the other while the scene is changing, are
produced by using two magic lanterns placed side by side, and
that can be a little inclined towards each other when necessary,
so as to mix together the rays of light proceeding from
the lenses of each, which produces that confusion of images,
in which one view melts as it were into the other, which gradually
becomes clear and distinct; the principle being the
gradual extinction of one picture, and the production of
another.</p>


<h3>HOW TO RAISE A GHOST.</h3>

<p>The magic lantern, or phantasmagoria, may be used in a
number of marvelous ways, but in none more striking than in
raising an apparent specter. Let an open box, about three
feet long, a foot and a half broad, and two feet high, be prepared.
At one end of this place a small swing dressing-glass,
and at the other let a magic lantern be fixed with its lenses in
a direction towards the glass. A glass should now be made
to slide up and down in the groove, to which a cord and pulley
should be attached, the end of the cord coming to the back
part of the box. On this glass the most hideous specter that
can be imagined may be painted, but in a squat or contracted
position, and when all is done, the lid of the box must be prepared
by raising a kind of gable at the end of the box, and in
its lower part an oval hole should be cut sufficiently large to
suffer the rays of light reflected from the glass to pass through
them. On the top of the box place a chafing-dish, upon which
put some burning charcoal. Now light the lamp in the lantern,
sprinkle some powdered camphor or white incense on
the charcoal, adjust the slide on which the specter is painted,
and the image will be thrown upon the smoke. In performing
this feat the room must be darkened, and the box should be<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
placed on a high table, that the hole through which the light
comes may not be noticed.</p>


<h3>THE THAUMATROPE.</h3>

<p>This word is derived from two Greek words, one of which
signifies <em>wonder</em>, and the other <em>to turn</em>. It is a very pretty
philosophical toy, and is founded upon the principle in optics
that an impression made upon the retina of the eye lasts for a
short interval after the object which produced it has been
withdrawn. The impression which the mind receives lasts for
about the eighth part of a second, as may be easily shown by
whirling round a lighted stick, which if made to complete the
circle within that period, will exhibit not a fiery point, but a
fiery circle in the air.</p>


<h3>THE BIRD IN THE CAGE.</h3>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard of the size of a penny piece, and
paint on one side a bird, and on the other a cage; fasten two
pieces of thread, one on each side at opposite points of the
card, so that the card can be made to revolve by twirling the
threads with the finger and thumb: while the toy is in its
revolution, the bird will be seen within the cage. A bat may
in the same manner be painted on one side of the card, and a
cricketer upon the other, which will exhibit the same phenomenon,
arising from the same principle.</p>


<h3>CONSTRUCTION OF THE PHANTASMASCOPE.</h3>

<p>The above named figure is a Thaumatrope, as much as the
one we are about to describe, although the term Phantasmascope
is generally applied to the latter instrument; which
consists of a disc of darkened tin-plate, with a slit or narrow
opening in it, about two inches in length. It is fixed upon a
stand, and the slit placed upwards, so that it may easily be
looked through. Another disc of pasteboard, about a foot in
diameter, is now prepared and fixed on a similar stand, but
with this difference, that it is made to revolve round an axis
in the center. On this pasteboard disc, paint in colors a
number of frogs in relative and progressive positions of leaping;
make between each figure a slit of about a quarter of an
inch deep: and when this second disc is made to revolve at
a foot distance behind the first, and the eye is placed near the
slit, the whole of the figures, instead of appearing to revolve
with the disc, will all appear in the attitudes of leaping up
and down, increasing in agility as the velocity of the motion
is increased. It is necessary, when trying the effect of this
instrument, to stand before a looking-glass, and to present
the painted face of the machine toward the glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>A very great number of figures may be prepared to produce
similar effects—horses with riders in various attitudes of leaping,
toads crawling, snakes twisting and writhing, faces laughing
and crying, men dancing, jugglers throwing up balls, etc.;
all of which, by the peculiar arrangement above detailed, will
seem to be in motion. A little ingenuity displayed in the
construction and painting of the figures upon the pasteboard
disc will afford a great fund of amusement.</p>


<h3>CURIOUS OPTICAL ILLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>One of the most curious facts relating to the science of
vision is the absolute insensibility of a certain portion of the
retina to the impression of light, so that the image of any object
falling on that point would be invisible. When we look
with the right eye, this point will be about fifteen degrees to
the right of the object observed, or to the right of the axis of
the eye, or the point of most distinct vision. When looking
with the left eye, the point will be as far to the left. The
point in question is the basis of the optic nerve, and its insensibility
to light was first observed by the French philosopher,
Mariotte. This remarkable phenomenon may be experimentally
proved in the following manner:—</p>

<p>Place on a sheet of writing-paper, at the distance of about
three inches apart, two colored wafers; then, on looking at
the left-hand wafer with the right eye, at the distance of about
a foot, keeping the eye straight above the wafer, and both
eyes parallel with the line which forms the wafers, the left eye
being closed, the right-hand wafer will become invisible; and
a similar effect will take place if we close the right eye, and
look with the left.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER.</h3>

<p>Cut a circular piece of white paper, about two inches in diameter,
and affix it to a dark wall. At the distance of two
feet on each side, but a little lower, make two marks; then
place yourself directly opposite the paper, and hold the end of
your finger before your face, so that when the right eye is
open it shall conceal the mark on your left, and when the left
eye is open the mark on your right. If you then look with
both eyes at the end of your finger the paper disc will be invisible.</p>


<h3>ANOTHER.</h3>

<p>Fix a similar disc of paper, two inches in diameter, at the
height of your eye on a dark wall; a little lower than this, at
the distance of two feet on the right hand, fix another of
about three inches in diameter; now place yourself opposite
the first sheet of paper, and, shutting the left eye, keep the<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
right eye still fixed on the first object, and when at the distance
of about ten feet, the second piece of paper will be invisible.</p>


<h3>THE PICTURE IN THE AIR.</h3>

<p>One of the numerous optical illusions which have from time
to time been evolved by scientific minds, is that of making an
image or picture appear in the air. This is produced by
means of a mirror, and an object in relief, upon which a
strong light is thrown—the mirror being set at such an angle
as to throw up the reflection of the image to a certain point
in the view of the spectator. This illusion is produced as
follows: Let a screen be constructed in which is an arched
aperture, the center of which may be five feet from the floor;
behind the screen is placed a large mirror of an elliptical
form. An object is now placed behind the screen, upon
which the light of a strong lamp is thrown from a point above
the mirror, and is received by the mirror and reflected to the
center of the arched cavity in the screen, where it will appear
to the spectator. Care should be taken to place the image in
an inverted position, and the light, which must be very powerful,
should be so placed that none of it may reach the
opening.</p>


<h3>TO SHOW THAT RAYS OF LIGHT DO NOT OBSTRUCT EACH
OTHER.</h3>

<p>Make a small hole in a sheet of pasteboard, and placing it
upright before three candles, placed closely together, it will
be found that the images of all the candle flames will be
formed separately on a piece of paper, laid on the table to receive
them. This proves that the rays of light do not obstruct
each other in their progress, although all cross in passing
through the hole.</p>


<h3>OPTICS OF A SOAP-BUBBLE.</h3>

<p>If a soap-bubble be blown up, and set under a glass, so that
the motion of air may not affect it, as the water glides down
the sides and the top grows thinner, several colors will successively
appear at the top, and spread themselves from thence
down the sides of the bubble, till they vanish in the same order
in which they appeared. At length a black spot appears at
the top, and spreads till the bubble bursts.</p>


<h3>THE KALEIDOSCOPE.</h3>

<p>If any object be placed between two plane mirrors, inclined
towards each other at an angle of thirty degrees, three several
images will be perceived in the circumference of a circle.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
On this principle is formed the kaleidoscope, invented by Sir
David Brewster, and by means of which the reflected images
viewed from a particular point exhibit symmetrical figures,
under an infinite arrangement of beautiful forms and colors.
The kaleidoscope may be bought at any novelty store, but it
is requisite that every young person should be able to construct
one for himself. He must, therefore, procure a tube
of tin or paper, of about ten inches in length, and two and a
half or three inches in diameter. One end of this should be
stopped up with tin or paper, securely fastened, in which is to
be made a hole, about the size of a small pea, for the eye to
look through. Two pieces of well-silvered looking-glass are
now to be procured; they must be not quite so long as the
tube, and they should be placed in it lengthways, at an angle
of 60 degrees, meeting together in a point, and separating to
an angle wide enough to insert the third piece; the polished
surfaces looking inwards. A circular piece of the glass is
now to be laid on the top of the edges of the reflectors;
which, by their not being quite so long as the tube, will allow
room for its falling in, and it will be supported by the edges
of the tube, which may be slightly bent over, to prevent the
glass from falling out. This having been done, now proceed
to make the “cap” of the instrument. A rim of tin or
pasteboard must be cut, so as to fit over the glass end of the
tube; and in this, on the outer side, a piece of ground glass
must be fastened, so that the whole may fit on the tube like
the lid of a pill-box. Then, before putting it on, obtain some
small pieces of broken glass of various colors, beads, little
strips of wire, or any other object, and place them in the cap;
and by passing it over the end, so that the broken glass, etc.,
has free motion, the instrument is complete. To use it, apply
the eye to the small hole, and, on turning it, the most
beautiful forms will appear, in the most wonderful combinations.</p>

<p>The following curious calculation has been made of the
number of changes this instrument will admit of. Supposing
it to contain 20 small pieces of glass, and that you make 10
changes in a minute, it will take an inconceivable space of
time, <i lang="la">i.e.</i> 462,880,899,576 years, and 360 days, to go through
the immense number of changes of which it is capable.</p>


<h3>SIMPLE SOLAR MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>Having made a circular hole in a window-shutter, about
three inches in diameter, place in it a glass lens of about
twelve inches focal distance. To the inside of the hole adapt
a tube, having at a small distance from the lens a slit, capable
of receiving one or two very thin plates of glass, to<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
where the object to be viewed must be affixed by means of a
little gum-water exceedingly transparent. Into this tube fit
another, furnished at its extremity with a lens half-an-inch
focal distance. Place a mirror before the hole of the window-shutter
on the outside, in such a manner as to throw the
light of the sun into the tube, and you will have a solar
magic lantern.</p>

<p>The method of employing this arrangement of lenses for
microscopic purposes is as follows:—Having darkened the
room, and by means of the mirror reflected the sun’s rays on
the glasses in a direction parallel to the axis, place some
small object between the two movable plates of glass, or affix
it to one of them with very transparent gum-water, and bring
it exactly into the axis of the tube; if the movable tube be
then pushed out or drawn in, till the object be a little beyond
the focus, it will be seen painted very distinctly on a card,
or piece of white paper, held at a proper distance, and will
appear to be greatly magnified. A small insect will appear
as a large animal, a hair as big as a walking-stick, and the
almost invisible eels in paste or vinegar as large as common
eels.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_MICROSCOPE">THE MICROSCOPE.</h2>
</div>


<p>At any time of the year or hour of the day there are few
pursuits more interesting, and at the same time instructive,
than the study of Nature by means of the microscope.</p>

<p>All of us must admire the more than awful grandeur of that
universe whereof we form so infinitesimal a part, wherein the
stars are scattered as the sand on the sea-shore, and every
star a sun, the center of a system of orbs too distant for the
eye of man to perceive. Looking at our nearest planet, and
observing on her face vast mountain-chains, ravines into
which the light of the sun can never penetrate, and volcanoes
whose craters are so wide that they would take in the whole
of New York, the whole of Philadelphia, and all the country
between them, we can judge by analogy of the unseen wonders
which must exist in the world beyond our ken.</p>

<p>But to him who can read Nature rightly, the microscope is
a teacher as grand as its sister instrument, and the awful
magnificence of Nature is as evident in a midge’s wing as in
the more patent glories of the sun, moon, and stars. In the
following pages we hope to put the readers of this book in the<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
way to read their microscope rightly—possibly to make it—and
to show that much can be done with small means when
“there’s a will,” and to indicate to them that objects of no
small interest can be found without stirring from the room in
which we sit, or even from the table on which our microscope
is placed.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may say, when they read the heading
of this paper, that they should like a microscope very much,
but that they have no money to buy it, and that their parents
cannot afford one.</p>

<p>This is just the feeling which we used to have when a boy,
for in those day microscopes were microscopes indeed, and you
had your choice between a little instrument, with a series of
brass cups, having glasses in them, which magnified slightly
but defined clearly, or a great composition of brass and iron,
looking like a rocket-tube, with an eye-piece at one end and
a glass shot at the other. It was very costly, very imposing,
and magnified very highly; but it strained the eyes painfully,
had no defining capacities, and made all the objects look as if
they were seen through a thick fog. Practically, therefore,
the former was the only instrument that was available.</p>

<p>A still more useful instrument, however, was that which can
always be obtained for a dollar or so, and which is now
made wonderfully cheap and wonderfully good; we mean the
double or treble pocket-lens. So we say, if you cannot afford
a really good microscope, do not waste your money upon inferior
and pretentious instruments, but get a sound pocket-lens.</p>

<p>It has a thousand advantages. It is portable, and is even
more useful in the fields than in the house. It defines very
clearly, and needs little trouble in manipulation. We need
not say how difficult is the task of getting a complicated instrument
to define properly, how impossible with a bad one.
The object and the glass can be held in any light,—a matter
of no small consideration when examining anything new, and
trying to make out its structure. It is not easily put out of
order, and if treated with the most ordinary care, will last for
a lifetime.</p>

<p>You can push it under water, and it will magnify as well as
in the air; and if you are wandering on the river-side, you can
lie down on the bank, dip the upper part of your head in
water, together with the glass, and watch carefully the sub-aquatic
objects without removing them. The water will not
hurt the eye in the least, though a non-swimmer may perhaps
find a little difficulty in his first attempt. It makes a good
burning-glass, should fire be needed, and no other means of
procuring a spark be at hand. It can be used so as to show<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
the principle of a camera obscura, and to illustrate the manner
in which photographic portraits are taken. It can be
made into an admirable dissecting microscope, and needs
scarcely any practice in the manipulation. These are some of
its advantages, and there are many others which need not be
mentioned.</p>

<p>Even if you should be able to procure a good microscope,
get a pocket-lens as well, for you will want them both, and
we may say that the most practiced microscopists, and those
who are possessors of the most elaborate instruments, are the
very men who are the most certain to have a pocket-lens about
them, and to use it most frequently. Practice well with the
pocket-lens before you meddle with the compound microscope.
You will waste no time, but will rapidly gain by it; for you
will be learning the rudiments of a new science, and laying a
solid foundation on which to build.</p>

<p>One or two practical remarks on the proper handling of the
pocket-lens may be of use. Do not always employ the same
eye in looking through the lens, but use the eyes alternately.
There is always a temptation to employ the same eye, which
receives a kind of training in vision; but it is a temptation
always to be resisted. With some persons the right eye is
most in favor, and with others the left; and when the favorite
eye gets all the work, it too frequently suffers. Whether you
look with the right or the left eye, <em>keep both eyes open</em>.</p>

<p>At first the beginner will find a little difficulty in restricting
his vision to one eye while the other remains open,
just as a beginner on the piano-forte feels himself puzzled
when he tries to make his right hand go one way and his left
hand another; but in either case a little practice and plenty
of perseverance are sure to overcome all obstacles, and in a
wonderfully short time the difficulty will not only be overcome,
but forgotten.</p>

<p>We speak here with some feeling, because, while engaged on
a work on the microscope, we were necessarily obliged to work
much at night, and inadvertently employed the left eye more
than the right; the consequence of which imprudence was
that we have been obliged ever since that time to give the
left eye perfect rest, as far as artificial vision goes, and,
except when looking through a binocular instrument, we have
not ventured to use it either to a microscope or a telescope.
The vision accommodates itself to circumstances with wonderful
ease, and the observer learns the curious art of cutting off
all communication between the unused eye and the brain; so
that, although the objects around may imprint themselves
upon the retina, the mind is as totally unconscious of them as
if they had no existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[52]</span></p>

<p>If possible, always examine an object <em>without removing it</em>,
as thereby you see it as it is, without altering any of the conditions
with which it is surrounded. Should this not be practicable,
take the object to be viewed in the left hand and the
lens in the right. Place the wrists of the two hands together,
and then you will find that one supports the other, and that
the lens can be held in the proper focus without the least difficulty.
After you have used the lens for some little time, you
will learn to hit upon the right focus almost to a hair’s
breadth,—so as to lose no time, a matter of some importance
when a living creature is to be examined, especially if it be in
motion.</p>

<p>We are now about to suggest a very simple piece of mechanism,
by which the pocket-lens can be converted into a
microscope that will serve for dissection and many other purposes.</p>

<p>Melt three or four pounds of lead in an iron ladle, and make
a mold, consisting of a hollow hemisphere of paper or cardboard,
through the center of which an iron rod has been
passed. The hollow of the paper should resemble an ordinary
saucer. Pour the lead into the saucer, and let it cool. The
paper mold will be scorched by the heat and rendered useless,
but an outer coating of lead will be cool and hard before
the paper is quite destroyed. Next take a piece of stout
brass wire and a wine-cork; twist the wire round the cork
several times; cut off one end close to the cork; sharpen the
other, and turn it up.</p>

<p>Bore a hole through the cork, just large enough to allow the
upright rod to slip through it, and there is the “stand” of
your microscope. Now take your pocket-lens, and get an
optician to bore a hole through one end of it, just large
enough to receive the upturned end of the wire; slip the lens
on the wire, and the microscope is complete.</p>

<p>The cork, though grasping the upright stem with tolerable
firmness, can be slid up and down so as to insure the correct
focus, and can be pushed aside whenever the object has to be
viewed with the naked eye, and must not be removed from its
place. This instrument is a capital one for dissecting purposes,
and will answer quite as well as those expensive affairs
that are to be purchased in the shops.</p>

<p>If the object be transparent, and requires to be seen by
transmitted light, the following plan will answer:—Take a
thin piece of wood, cut or punch a round hole out of the middle,
and support it on four legs. Wires or wooden pegs fixed
in corks will answer the purpose well, and if the corks be glued
to the corners of the board, the legs can be inserted or
removed at pleasure. The wood of which cigar-boxes are<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
made will answer the purpose very well. Its dimensions
should be about three inches in length by two in width. Now
buy one of the doll’s looking-glasses that are sold for a penny,
and put it under the stand. Lay a flat piece of glass over the
hole, place the object upon it, and direct the light through it
by means of the mirror below. If such a mirror cannot be
obtained, it is easy enough to make one, by mounting a piece
of looking-glass in a cork frame, and making it swing
on pivots, like the glasses of our dressing-rooms.</p>

<p>The young microscopist must remember that when he is examining
any object by transmitted light, he must arrange it
as flatly as possible on the glass. In many cases, a still
neater manipulation is required—as, for example, when the
petals of flowers are under examination. Thin glass is to be
purchased at any optician’s, and if cut in squares, instead of
circles, is very much cheaper, and quite as useful for all practical
purposes. Lay the petal on the glass plate, place a
piece of the thin glass upon it, and press it gently while examining
it. If it still remains thick and dull, put a drop of pure
water on the petal, and replace the thin glass, when the
structure will almost invariably be detected.</p>

<p>Everything depends on the proper management of the object
and the arrangement of the light. Some opaque objects can
be seen best by direct light, and others by transmitted light.
If a leaf be examined, particularly if it be a thick and heavy
one, like that of the ivy, the upper and lower membranes
must be stripped apart—a task which is easily performed by
tearing a small slit, and then ripping it smartly across. A
pair of forceps will be required for this and other delicate
work, and may be obtained at a cheap rate. Care must be
taken to keep the points exactly even, and if at any time one
of them appears to be shorter than the other, they should be
rubbed on a hone until they are brought perfectly level.</p>

<p>These should be made of steel; but the young microscopist
will find that a second pair, made of brass, and much rougher
in finish, are invaluable aids as he takes his walks into the
country. By their aid he can pick up minute objects, draw
insects out of crevices without damaging them, and pluck the
tiniest flowers without harming their petals. They can be
carried in the waistcoat pocket, and the cost is sixpence.
Any lad who knows how to handle solder can make a pair for
himself in a few minutes.</p>

<p>A penknife with one blade kept scrupulously sharp is essential,
and we have found an old lancet of the greatest service.
Lancets have gone so much out of fashion, that the second-hand
instrument shops abound with them. We did not allow
our own lancet to be shut up, but removed the blade from the<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
tortoise-shell handle, and fixed it upon a wooden handle,
about four inches in length, so that it looked very clumsy, but
was extremely useful.</p>

<p>Two pairs of scissors are needful,—one very fine and the
other moderately strong. Both pairs, however, must have
very short blades and very long handles, and the scissors such
as ladies use are of very little use, the short handles causing
the fingers of the right hand to shade the object. As to the
fine pair, it is hardly possible to have the handles too long or
the blades too short; for if the points can be separated a
quarter of an inch, nothing more is needed. If a pair of bent
scissors can also be obtained, they are extremely pleasant to
work with, and save much trouble.</p>

<p>Pill-boxes of various sizes are of very great service to the
microscopist. We always have them arranged in “nests,”
<i lang="la">i. e.</i>, six or seven inside each other, so that space is greatly
economized, as long as they are not in absolute use. All delicate
objects should be placed in separate boxes, and the predaceous
insects must be treated in the same manner, or they
will certainly destroy one another, or, at all events, inflict such
injuries as will make them useless for microscopic purposes.</p>

<p>When the insects are to be killed on the spot, we employ
another and a very simple plan.</p>

<p>We take one of the old-fashioned wooden lucifer-match
boxes, bore a hole in the lid, and push through the hole a
swan-quill, or the barrel of one of the swan-quill steel pens.
A glass tube is still better, but is too fragile. Beeswax is
tightly worked into the junction of the tube with the wood, so
as to make it as nearly air-tight as possible. A cork stopper
is then cut to fit the tube. When this is finished, we take the
smallest-sized pill-box, bore a number of holes in it with a
red-hot needle, place a little piece of solid ammonia within it,
and inclose it in the lucifer-box. Its effects are almost instantaneous;
for scarcely has the insect touched the bottom
of the box before it is helpless, and in a very few moments it
is quite dead, so powerful is ammonia towards insects. The
reader will of course understand that the pill-boxes must never
have been used for pills, and that the match-box must be carefully
cleaned before employing it in the microscopic service.
Moreover, any boxes that have been used for insects become
useless, inasmuch as the scales always fall from the wings, and
cling to the sides of the box, so as to mix with succeeding
objects, and very much puzzle the observer.</p>

<p>Aquatic and marine objects require bottles, and, as a general
rule, these bottles ought always to have wide mouths.
Indeed, if there be no shoulder at all, their purpose will be
better served, as a small object is very apt to be caught under<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
the shoulder, and to give much trouble before it can be removed
without injury. Wide and short test-tubes answer
admirably for collecting; and it will always be advisable to
have a few small test-tubes ready fitted with corks, for the
purpose of isolating those specimens which might receive or
cause injury by being mixed with others.</p>

<p>To remove minute objects from one vessel into another is a
very easy process. Take a glass tube, mark off a portion
about eight inches in length, cut a little notch with a file, and
bend it smartly, when it will break neatly across, without
leaving points or having the regularity of its ends injured by
gaps. Turn each end round and round in the flame of the
spirit-lamp, and you have an ordinary “pipette.” The object
of placing the ends of the tube in the flame is to render the
edges quite smooth and rounded.</p>

<p>Now mark off the same length of tube, and place the
marked portion in the flame, taking care to warm it well first,
lest the sudden heat should crack the glass. Keep it continually
turning between the fingers, and when it is quite soft,
and of a fine red heat, draw the hands smartly apart, and you
will produce a couple of tubes tapering to very fine points.
Break off the tapering portions at any convenient point,
round the edges as before, and you will then have pipettes
suitable for small objects. As there are many specimens,
especially the smaller animalculæ, which have a habit of retiring
into the remotest corner, it is necessary to bend another
pipette, so as to follow them. For our own part, we prefer
the pipette to be bent nearly to a right angle.</p>

<p>The mode of using these simple instruments is as follows:—Place
the forefinger or thumb firmly on the large end, and
push the point under water. When the opening is close
to the sought-for object, lift the finger suddenly, and admit
the air into the tube. The water will immediately rush
in at the lower end, and if the orifice has been properly
directed, will carry the object into the tube. The finger is
again applied to the mouth of the tube, and the object can be
then carried off.</p>

<p>As with the pocket-lens almost every object is to be viewed
by means of direct light, the young observer will find himself
much aided by a suitable background. Any small object,
such as a minute insect, a seed, or a hair, becomes very indistinct
if held up against the light, or even when viewed
against a broken background of trees, houses, or herbage. The
simplest plan of securing a proper background is to take a
disc of ivory or even of white cardboard, and to blacken one
side of it. The black paint which is used for this purpose
must be without gloss, and have what is called a “dead” surface.<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
Ink answers very well for the purpose, and so does
ivory-black; but Indian ink is too glossy to be serviceable.</p>

<p>To procure specimens from the water is a matter of some
difficulty if managed badly, but easy enough when the collector
knows his business. It is of course needful to attach the
collecting vessel to the end of a rod, and to plunge it into the
spots which look most favorable. Now even so simple a matter
as this requires some little care, if the young microscopist
really wishes to obtain the best specimens. A common walking-stick
will answer most purposes; but the most efficient rod
for the purpose is one of the common walking-stick fishing-rods
without the top joint, as it can be carried without attracting
attention, and can be lengthened at will by adding
the different joints.</p>

<p>Many methods have been proposed by which the vessel is to
be attached to the rod; but that which I am about to describe
is certainly the simplest and most effective that I have tried.
Get a piece of gutta-percha tubing, just large enough to be
slipped on the end of the rod or stick; mark off an inch or so,
and cut the tube nearly through, then cut it away longitudinally,
so that a long tongue of gutta-percha is left, and the instrument
is completed.</p>

<p>Its application is as simple as its structure. Bend the
tongue over, so as to form a loop, and push the end through
the short tube. Slip the neck of the bottle into the loop, and
draw the tongue until it is tolerably tight. Push the end of
the stick into the tube, taking care to hold the tongue firmly
in its place, and the vessel will then be fastened at right angles
to the stick.</p>

<p>The method of collecting by means of this instrument is as
follows: Immerse the vessel in the water, with the mouth
downwards, so that no water may enter. Push it gently towards
the spot which is to be investigated, move it about a
little, so as to cause a disturbance, and then turn the vessel
with its mouth upwards. Water will instantly rush in, carrying
with it the objects which are to be examined. The contents
of the vessel may then be transferred to the large bottle,
and another dip made. Confervoid growths, especially those
which accumulate in a kind of scum on the surface, should be
obtained very quietly, without previous disturbance of the
water.</p>

<p>After the pond, or stream, or ditch has been well searched,
the bottle should be roughly examined, by means of a pocket-lens,
and the contents sorted into the smaller tubes, as has
already been mentioned. This precaution is especially needful
when any of the minute crustacea called Entomostraca
are captured, as they are most voracious beings, and will<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
make sad havoc among other specimens, unless they are
placed in separate bottles. They are mostly large enough to
be detected with the naked eye, and look something like little
fleas as they move along.</p>

<p>As the Entomostraca cast their shells repeatedly during
their lives, some species performing this operation every two
days, a beautiful series of objects can be obtained by gathering
the cast shells and preparing them for the microscope, according
to the directions that will be found in the following
pages. These shells are peculiarly valuable, as they retain
the chief external characteristics of the creature to which they
belonged, the limbs, plumes, and even the delicate bristles
being preserved entire. It is in the power of the microscopist
to retard or hasten the change of shell, heat and light aiding
development, and cold and darkness retarding it. The
remarkable “ephippium,” or saddle, which is found on the
backs of the Daphnia, the Moina, and other Entomostraca,
and which is used as a receptacle for eggs, should be searched
for and preserved.</p>

<p>A very thin and a very flat bottle is a most useful assistance
in detecting the character of any unknown object, especially
if it be living. Such a bottle may easily be made by heating
one of the small test tubes in the spirit lamp until it is of a
glowing red heat, and then pressing the sides together. Some
little neatness is required in this process, as an unskillful operator
is apt to press the sides unequally, and to leave a bulging
projection at the end.</p>


<h3>THE COMPOUND MICROSCOPE.</h3>

<p>We have already described the simpler forms of magnifying
instruments, together with the best method of using them.
We now purpose to describe the more complicated instrument
called the compound microscope, and hints will be given as to
the best method of making preparations for it.</p>

<p>The great distinction between the simple and compound
microscope is, that whereas the former instrument magnifies
the object, the latter magnifies the magnified image of the
object. In the least elaborate form of this instrument there
are two glasses, one at each end of a tube, the small glass
magnifying the object, and being therefore called the “object-glass,”
while the other, which magnifies the image of the object,
is placed next to the eye, and is therefore termed the
“eye-glass.” In practice, however, this arrangement is
found to be so extremely defective, that the instrument was
quite useless except as an experimental toy; for the two enemies
of the optician, chromatic and spherical aberration, prevailed
so exceedingly, that every object appeared as if surrounded<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
with prismatic colors, and every line was blurred and
indistinct.</p>

<p>In this uncertain state the compound microscope remained
for many years, its superb capabilities being scarcely recognized.
The chief fault was thought to be in the material of
which the object-glass was made, and for a long series of
years all experiments were conducted with a view to an improvement
in this respect. When, however, the diamond had
been employed as an object-glass, and had failed equally with
those of less costly material, attention was directed to the
right point—namely, the arrangement of the different glasses,—and
at length opticians succeeded in obtaining a pitch of
excellence which can be almost termed perfection. It would
be impossible to describe the method which is employed for
this purpose, and it must suffice to say that the principle is
that of playing off one defect against another, and so making
them mutually correct their errors.</p>

<p>The magnifying powers of the compound microscope can be
very great, and it is therefore necessary that extreme care
should be taken in its manipulation. It will be possible for
a clumsy person to do more damage to a good instrument in
three minutes than can be repaired in as many weeks.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the management of the microscope
and the construction of the “slides,” we will briefly describe
one or two chief forms of the compound microscope.</p>

<p>The simplest form of the compound microscope, as at present
made, consists of a stand and a sliding tube, in which are
set the glasses which magnify the object and its image. At
the top is the tube, which is capable of being slid up and
down in the shoulder of the stand, so as to obtain the proper
focus. Above is seen the eye-glass; and the object-glass is
shown at the bottom of the tube. Below the object-glass is
the “stage” on which the object to be magnified is laid; and
lowest of all is a mirror, which serves to reflect the light upwards
through the object, and which can be turned by means
of the knobs at the sides. The object-glass is composed of
two pieces, which can readily be separated. If both are used,
sufficient magnifying power is gained to show the scales on a
butterfly’s wing and similar minute objects; while, if one is
removed, the object is not magnified to so great an extent,
but a larger portion can be seen, and the definition is clearer.
The cost of this instrument, together with a few accessories,
is about $2.50.</p>

<p>The proper light is our next point, and upon it rests the
chief beauty of the effect. The light which will suit one object
will not suit another, and even the same object should be
examined under every variety of light. Some objects are best<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
shown when the light is thrown <em>upon</em> them from above, and
others when it is thrown <em>through</em> them from below. Again,
the direction of light is of vast importance; for it will easily
be seen that an oblique light will exhibit minute projections
by throwing a shadow on one side and brilliancy on the other,
while a vertical illumination would fail to show them. On
the same principle, one object will be shown better with the
light in front, and another when it is on one side.</p>

<p>One of the most effective means of attaining this object is
by using the “bull’s-eye condenser,” which is sometimes fixed
to the stage, but is usually detached. As the upright stem is
telescopic, the glass can be raised to a considerable height,
while the joint and sliding-rod permit the lens to be applied at
any angle which promises the most brilliant light.</p>

<p>As for the kind of light that is employed, there is nothing
which equals that of a white cloud; but such clouds are rare,
and are at the best extremely transient, and can only be seen
by day, various artificial methods of illumination have been
invented. Novices generally think that when the sky is
bright and blue they will be very successful in their illumination,
and feel grievously disappointed at finding that they obtained
much more light from the clouds, whose disappearance
they had anxiously been watching. Finding that the blue
sky gives scarcely any light at all, they rush to the other extreme,
turn the mirror towards the sun, and pour such a blaze
of light upon the object, that the eye is blinded by the scintillating
refulgence, and the object is often injured because
the mirror is capable of reflecting heat as well as light.</p>

<p>In the daytime there is nothing better than the “white-cloud
illuminator,” which is made easily enough by means of
plaster of Paris. A sheet of thin white paper fastened
against a window-pane is also useful; and the simple plan of
dabbing the glass with putty will have a beneficial effect in
softening the light, when the window has a southern aspect.
In default of these conveniences, it will be often sufficient to
fix a piece of white letter paper over the mirror, or even to
dull its surface with wax. At all events, he who aspires to
be a true microscopist must be ready with expedients, and if
he finds himself in a difficulty, he must summarily invent a
method of obviating it.</p>

<p>At night a lamp is necessary; candles are useless, because
they have two faults—they flicker, and they become lower as
they burn. The latter defect can be cured by using a candle-lamp,
but no arrangement will cure the flame of flickering; it
is peculiarly trying to the eyes, and destructive of accurate
definition. An ordinary moderator lamp answers pretty well,
and a small one is even better for the microscopist than one<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
of large dimensions. The chief drawback to the moderator
lamp is that the flame cannot be elevated or lowered, so that
the only way to procure a light at a higher elevation is to
stand the lamp on a block of wood or a book. Small lamps
are, however, made expressly for the microscope, and, if
possible, should be procured, and used for no other purpose,
and intrusted to no other hands.</p>

<p>If you want a really brilliant, clear, white light, you must
trim the lamp yourself. A small piece of pale blue or neutral-tint
glass interposed between the lamp and the microscope
has a wonderful effect in diminishing the yellow hue which
belongs more or less to all artificial lights which are produced
by the combustion of oil or fat. We have no doubt but that
in a few years we shall be rid of the clumsy and dirty machines
that we call lamps, and have substituted for them the pure
brilliancy of the electric light.</p>

<p>Whatever lamp you use, a shade is absolutely necessary, in
order to defend the eyes. Let me here warn my young readers
that they cannot be too careful of their eyes. In the exuberance
of youthful strength and health we are too apt to
treat our eyes as unceremoniously as our digestion, and in
later years we awake to unavailing repentance.</p>

<p>Another point which calls for extreme attention is the perfect
cleanliness of the glasses. It is astonishing how a tiny
dust-mote, or the least condensation of damp, will diminish
the powers of the microscope, and how often the instrument
is blamed for indistinctness when the real fault lies in the carelessness
of the operator. Even when the greatest care is
taken, dust is sure to settle on the glasses, especially on the
eye-piece, and before using the microscope the glasses ought
to be carefully examined. Never wipe them with an ordinary
handkerchief, but get a piece of new wash-leather; beat it
well until no dust issues from it, and then put it into a box
with a tightly-fitting cover. Use this, and nothing else, for
cleaning the glasses, and you will avoid those horrid scratches
with which the eye-glass and object-glass of careless operators
are always disfigured.</p>

<p>Moisture is very apt to condense on the glasses and to ruin
their clearness. If the microscope be brought from a cold
into a warm room, the glasses will be instantly covered with
moisture, just as the outside of a tumbler of cold water is
always covered with fine dew when brought into a warm
room. The microscope should therefore be kept at least an
hour in the room wherein it is to be used, so that the instrument
and the atmosphere may be of the same temperature.
You should make the microscope a trifle warmer than the
surrounding atmosphere, and so avoid all danger of condensation.<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
When changing the object glass or eye-piece, always
keep the hand as far away from the glass as possible,
and manipulate with the tip of the forefinger and thumb. The
human skin always gives out so much exhalation, that even
when the hand is cold the glasses will be dimmed; and it is a
peculiarity of such moisture, that it adheres to the glasses
with great pertinacity, and does not evaporate like the dew
which is condensed from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>In order to insure perfect success in this important particular,
the young microscopist will do well to get the optician
from whom he purchased his instrument to explain its construction,
and to give him a lesson or two in the art of taking
it to pieces and putting it together again; for unless each
glass can be separately cleaned, no one can be quite sure that
the instrument will perform as it ought to do. The best
method of ascertaining whether it is quite clean is to throw
the light upwards by means of the mirror, and then to turn
the eye-piece slowly round. If any dust or moisture has
collected either upon the eye-glass or the “field-glass,” which
forms the second lens of the eye-piece, it will be immediately
detected. Turning the object-glass will in a similar manner
detect impurities upon its surface.</p>
